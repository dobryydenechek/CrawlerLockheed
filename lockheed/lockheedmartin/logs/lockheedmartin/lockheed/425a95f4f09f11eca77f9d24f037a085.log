 'text': 'Andover, Mass., June 14, 2022 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has been '
         'awarded a contract to build the first megawatt-scale, long-duration '
         'energy storage system for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). '
         'GridStar® Flow will be installed at Fort Carson, Colorado for the '
         'U.S. Army under the management of the U.S. Army Engineer Research '
         'and Development Center’s (ERDC) Construction Engineering Research '
         'Laboratory (CERL). GridStar Flow is an innovative redox flow battery '
         'designed for large-capacity storage applications that stores power '
         'generated from renewable energy sources and dispatches it to '
         'electric grids during peak demand or unanticipated electricity loss. '
         "Lockheed Martin's first customer-sited production system is intended "
         'as a demonstration unit for the Army and ERDC-CERL. This system will '
         'be tested against protocols that simulate microgrid and renewable '
         'integration to\xa0ensure critical missions can continue in the event '
         'of a long-term power outage. It is expected to have a discharge '
         'duration of 10 hours. “Electric grids are undergoing unprecedented '
         'change.\xa0Energy requirements are shifting as we consider renewable '
         'resources coupled with utility-scale, long-duration storage\xa0'
         'options,” said Dr. Andrew J. Nelson, director, CERL. “Solutions to '
         'increase resiliency and self-sufficiency are crucial to economically '
         'and sustainably supporting DoD operations.” Insights gained from '
         'this pilot project could support the deployment of future '
         'long-duration storage across all DoD services and installations. “We '
         'are committed to supporting the U.S. Army’s climate strategy to '
         'foster modernization and readiness across the force, while seeking '
         'out solutions that offer a more secure, sustainable and cleaner '
         'future,” said Tom Jarvi, Lockheed Martin GridStar Flow program '
         'director. “GridStar Flow is designed to meet emerging, long-duration '
         'energy storage needs and bolster the necessary grid resilience to '
         'combat 21 st century security challenges.” Lockheed Martin, '
         'ERDC-CERL and the U.S Army plan to break ground on this GridStar '

 'text': 'EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., May 17 2022 – The U.S. Air Force and '
         'Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] successfully conducted a '
         'hypersonic-boosted flight test of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid '
         'Response Weapon (ARRW) from the service’s B-52H Stratofortress. The '
         'successful flight demonstrates the weapon’s ability to reach and '
         'withstand operational hypersonic speeds, collect crucial data for '
         'use in further flight tests, and validate safe separation from the '
         'aircraft to deliver the glide body and warhead to designated targets '
         'from significant standoff distances. “The need for hypersonic strike '
         'capabilities is critical to our nation and this successful test will '
         'help us to maintain an accelerated and rigorous timeline,” said Dave '
         'Berganini, vice president of Hypersonic and Strike Systems at '
         'Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. “Our strong partnership '
         'with the U.S. Air Force has allowed us to quickly progress '
         'hypersonic technologies for our men and women in uniform.” “The ARRW '
         'rapid prototyping program used Section 804 authorities provided by '
         'Congress to significantly accelerate the development and test of '
         'this system, without sacrificing engineering rigor,” said Marya '
         'Bard, U.S. Air Force ARRW program director. “The tightly integrated '
         'Lockheed Martin and government team achieved speed with discipline '
         'by focusing on a common vision of providing combatant commanders a '
         'survivable rapid response strike capability as early as possible.” '
         'Additional booster and all-up-round test flights will continue '
         'throughout 2022, before reaching Early Operational Capability (EOC) '
         'in 2023. Hypersonic weapons provide a rapid response, time critical '
         'capability to overcome distance in contested environments using high '
         'speed, altitude and maneuverability. Hypersonic technology has '
         'continued to present several complex engineering challenges. Going '
         'Mach 5, sometimes even faster, generates extreme levels of heat, '
         'driving the need for innovative materials, sensors and electronics '
         'to withstand such speeds throughout its journey. In addition to '
         'heat, these systems must be able to maintain consistent '
         'communication connections, as well as considerable intelligence to '
         'perform precise maneuverability techniques to overcome a wide range '
         'of advanced defense systems and extreme contested environments. '
         'Lockheed Martin is proud to support multiple hypersonic systems '
         'development projects and is leveraging resources, talents, and '
         'lessons learned across the corporation to positively influence '

         'next strategic tanker." The LMXT is built on the combat-proven '
         'design of the\xa0Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT),\xa0'
         'which is the strategic tanking choice of 14 nations around the '
         'world. Offering several distinct U.S. Air Force-only capabilities '
         'designed to meet operator requirements, the LMXT offers advantages '
         'like\xa0an established fly-by-wire aerial refueling boom. Currently '
         'certified and used by allies to refuel U.S. Air Force aircraft in '
         "operations globally, the world's first fully automatic air-to-air "
         'refueling (A3R) system is a discrete asset. "We are excited to '
         'continue expanding our U.S. footprint by partnering with the state '
         'of Arkansas to create the LMXT refueling boom production site and '
         'center of excellence. It is an honor to bring Airbus innovation to '
         'the state for this and future manufacturing opportunities," said '
         'C.\xa0Jeffrey Knittel, chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas. "The '
         'state-of-the-art boom system is a vital aspect of the overall LMXT '
         'offering, and we are proud to be working with Arkansans to build '
         'this best-in-class solution for the U.S. Air Force." While the exact '
         'location of the manufacturing facility has yet to be determined, it '
         'will expand Airbus\' footprint into "The Natural State." '
         'Manufacturing plays a significant role in the Arkansas economy, '
         "accounting for about 15% of the state's economic output. More than "
         '12% of all Arkansas residents are employed by the manufacturing '
         'industry, according to the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. '
         '"Lockheed Martin consistently sets the standard for aerospace and '
         "defense worldwide and significantly contributes to Arkansas' robust "
         'aerospace and defense industry," said Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson . '
         '" Arkansas has the tools in place to help high-tech manufacturing '
         "succeed, and I'm pleased that Lockheed Martin and Airbus see "
         'themselves growing here in our state as they look to the future in '
         'the defense industry." Lockheed Martin\'s manufacturing presence in '
         'Arkansas dates back to 1978 with its Camden Operations facility. '
         'This facility is a manufacturing, final assembly, test and storage '
         'operation for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) '
         "programs. Approximately 1,030 employees work in the facility's "
         'manufacturing and support buildings. "I am thrilled Arkansas has '
         "been selected to manufacture the LMXT's boom, bringing well-paying "
         'jobs to our state and strengthening our economy. Most importantly, '
         "I'm proud Arkansas will continue to increase our contributions in "
         "support of America's men and women in uniform and our national "
         'defense," said U.S. Sen. John Boozman , who serves as the senior '
         'senator from Arkansas. The LMXT aerial refueling system work is the '
         'first manufacturing opportunity for Airbus in Arkansas , but builds '
         'on an extensive manufacturing presence across the southeastern '
         'United States . Airbus builds the A320 and A220 airliners in Alabama '
         ', H125 and UH-72 Lakota helicopters in Mississippi , and satellites '
         'in Florida . The workforce across these facilities is more than 30% '
         'U.S. military veterans. "Flights of freedom will be sustained by '
         'equipment made right here in Arkansas ! This announcement further '
         "strengthens the Third District's role in our nation's defense, and "
         "our community's strong workforce and infrastructure are ready to "
         'support the manufacturing of the state-of-the-art LMXT system," said '
         "U.S. Rep. Steve Womack , who represents Arkansas' 3rd Congressional "
         'District. "Arkansans are proud knowing the leading role they\'ll '
         "have in building the next generation of the Air Force's "
         "capabilities. I look forward to a fair and open competition that I'm "
         'sure the LMXT will win." This announcement follows Lockheed '
         "Martin's and Airbus' recently publicized plan to expand their "
         'footprints in Georgia and Alabama to support future LMXT assembly '
         'and configuration. The\xa0 LMXT will be built in two phases: '
         'Integration of the Arkansas -built boom will be included in Phase 2 '
         'of the assembly and configuration process. The LMXT complements the '
         "U.S. Air Force's tanker capabilities by providing the most advanced "
         "aerial refueler to meet America's immediate and long-term mission "
         'requirements. The LMXT strengthens and expands the U.S. aerospace '
         'industrial base by working with existing and new American suppliers. '
         '"Arkansans are proud of the men and women who fight for our freedoms '
         'and the civilian workers who support them," Arkansas Secretary of '
         'Commerce Mike Preston said. "The LMXT tanker will be built in '
         'America, by Americans, for Americans — a mission that Arkansas '
         'encourages all manufacturers to embrace as we seek to bring quality '
         'jobs back to the U.S.A. and increase economic opportunities for '
         'American workers and American communities." The LMXT offers a proven '
         'airframe with distinct U.S. Air Force-only capabilities designed to '
         'meet operator requirements, with advantages that also include: As '
         'the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin works directly to implement '
         'U.S. Air Force-specific requirements within the LMXT. For additional '

 'text': 'Syracuse, N.Y. June 8, 2022 – On May 26, 2022, the STARE Project '
         'Office, U.S. Army Sentinel Product Office received the first five '
         'radars of its initial contract with Lockheed Martin. The Sentinel A4 '
         'radar is developed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Syracuse, '
         'N.Y., and has been on an accelerated schedule since the project was '
         'awarded in September 2019. “We are one step closer to getting this '
         'enhanced capability to our warfighters,” stated Leah Cook, Sentinel '
         'Product Director for the U.S. Army Sentinel A4 program office. “The '
         'delivery of the first five radars is a result of collaboration and a '
         'continued commitment to the U.S. Army.” The U.S. Army and Lockheed '
         'Martin have a strong partnership founded on collaboration and trust. '
         'The process has included virtual reviews and working groups to '
         'maintain momentum through all program development phases. “Our team '
         'understands the criticality of this technology and the need to get '
         'it fielded,” said Mark Mekker, director of Army Radars for Lockheed '
         'Martin. “Our soldiers are in unpredictable environments, and the '
         'Sentinel A4 will provide improved eyes on the field to keep them '
         'safe.” What’s Next? Lockheed Martin will support the Army in the '
         'government test program phase into early 2023. The radars will '
         'undergo mobility, environmental, radar performance and logistics '
         'testing. Production of the next five radar systems is already '
         'underway, and delivery is expected to begin in March 2023. Future '
         'Forward to Protect Against Evolving Threats The Sentinel A4’s open '
         'scalable radar architecture is the cornerstone of the radar system’s '
         'design and allows for addressing evolving threats with software '
         'modifications only. The new air and missile defense radar will '
         'provide improved capability over the previous iteration, the '
         'Sentinel A3. It will outperform the legacy radar, delivering '
         'improvements in contested environments against cruise missiles, '
         'unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft, and '
         'rocket, artillery, and mortar threats.\xa0 This includes enhanced '
         'surveillance, detection, and classification capabilities to protect '
         'U.S. Army maneuver formations. Efficiencies & Cost Savings Lockheed '
         'Martin radars are designed with a high degree of commonality. The '
         'company’s TPY-4 ground based air surveillance radar was built and '
         'validated under Lockheed Martin investment and significantly '
         'leveraged the Sentinel A4 radar design. “Commonality across the '
         'radar portfolio enable sustainment efficiencies and significant cost '
         'savings for our customers. Our scalable technology, coupled with '
         'these efficiencies, has resulted in significant international '
         'interest in both the Sentinel A4 and TPY-4 radars to replace older '
         'assets that simply cannot be upgraded to match what our next '
         'generation systems are offering,” said Chandra Marshall, Vice '
         'President and General Manager of Lockheed Martin’s Radar and Sensor '
         'Systems business. Lockheed Martin continues to invest significantly '
         'in the advancement of its software-defined radar technology, '

         'teaming agreement for future T-50 opportunities, the newest '
         'partnership in the decades-long relationship between the companies. '
         '“Lockheed Martin is an air power solutions leader, delivering '
         'capabilities across the entire spectrum of training and combat '
         'aircraft,” says Aimee Burnett, vice president, Integrated Fighter '
         'Group Business Development at Lockheed Martin. “We are proud to '
         'continue to partner with KAI on the T-50 to leverage our collective '
         'experiences to train the next generation of pilots to fly, fight and '
         'win." She says the T-50 is a proven aircraft program that reduces '
         'the learning curve for new pilots and gets them flying operational '
         'sorties faster – even in fifth-generation aircraft like the F-35. '
         'That’s important as air forces around the world need to get their '
         'pilots up to speed faster than ever before, whether that’s to fill a '
         'gap in personnel or due to increased frequency of combat missions. '
         '“That’s where the benefits of the proven T-50 program really come '
         'into play,” she says.\xa0“The seamless training experience with the '
         'T-50 gives student pilots an additional edge and fully prepares them '
         '– in less time than in the past – to fly any combat mission.” The '
         'program has reduced the number of required flights for Korean pilots '
         'learning in the KF-16 to only nine sorties. Feedback from many of '
         'the 2,500 pilots who have been trained in the T-50 across 3,750 test '
         'flights says it’s easy to fly and offers controls similar to other '
         'Lockheed Martin aircraft like the F-16 and F-35. This allows student '
         'pilots to focus their airmanship skills on improved aero '
         'performance, digital flight controls and next-generation air traffic '
         'management systems. Additionally, a ground-based training system '
         'contains an array of innovative technologies to provide options for '
         'training in a simulation environment. Digital Advances in '
         'Production, Sustainment At any given time, around the world, '
         'Lockheed Martin is working side-by-side with those in uniform to '
         'keep fleets ready to fly at a moment’s notice. “We are focused on '
         'readiness for the fleets and customers we support and bringing new '
         'digital tools to enable new capabilities,” Aimee says. “And we’re '
         'seeing success. As an example, with the T-50, the mission capable '
         'rate is holding strong at 90% across 300,000 flight hours – an '
         'outstanding result that demonstrates our focus.” And from a '
         'production standpoint, T-50 components can be shipped to a single '
         'location and produced with minimal space with maximum ease. That’s '
         'because aircraft components would be shipped in two containers and '
         'ready upon arrival in their home destination, for final assembly and '
         'check-out. Additional T-50 Facts The T-50 program was originally '
         'developed by KAI in partnership with Lockheed Martin, and took its '
         'maiden flight in 2002 and its first production flight in 2005. Since '
         'then, 208 have been produced with an additional 28 on order across a '

         "for the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, validating the platform's "
         'operational readiness to forward deploy Marines and equipment across '
         'the globe. Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company (NYSE: LMT) designed '
         'and manufactures the CH-53K , which enables the U.S. Marine Corps '
         'and international militaries to move troops and equipment from ship '
         'to shore, and to higher altitude terrain, more quickly and '
         'effectively than ever before.     "This declaration is a vote of '
         'confidence from Marine Corps leadership and demonstrates the '
         'critical role of the CH-53K, giving forces more range and agility to '
         'conduct expeditionary heavy-lift assault transport of armored '
         'vehicles, equipment, and personnel. This capability is critical in '
         'the Indo-Pacific region and around the globe in support of the joint '
         'force and allies," said Sikorsky President Paul Lemmo . "Sikorsky '
         'and our nationwide CH-53K supply chain, including dozens of small '
         'businesses, are committed to delivering aircraft that can adapt to '
         'future missions and are reliable, sustainable and relevant for '
         'decades to come." The path to CH-53K IOC included collaboration on '
         'Initial Operational Testing & Evaluation among Sikorsky, the U.S. '
         'Navy and U.S. Marine Corps to develop, test and validate the '
         'advanced capabilities of this 21 st century aircraft. Marines have '
         'been flying and supporting the CH-53K in the fleet environment '
         'demonstrating the aircraft is on track to fully deploy on schedule. '
         'The aircraft have flown more than 3,000 flight hours showcasing the '
         "CH-53K's performance in a range of mission scenarios including "
         'extreme cold and hot environments. Other accomplishments include: '
         'The IOC declaration positions the Marine Corps for a full rate '
         'production decision in 2023. The Approved Acquisition Objective is '
         '200 aircraft. The CH-53K high-tech production line in Stratford, '
         'Connecticut , is active with seven aircraft in build, including '
         'three on schedule to deliver to the Marine Corps this year. There '
         'are 46 aircraft fully on contract including four heavy-lift '
         'helicopters for the government of Israel and another 14 aircraft on '

         'profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries '
         'or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment '

         'be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking '
         "rates on the company's contracts. Increases in profit booking rates, "
         'typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually '
         'relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the '
         'performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a '
         'particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract '
         'may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total '

         'profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable '
         'profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates '

         'commercial civil space programs due to lower net favorable profit '
         'adjustments and volume (the HLS program). Operating profit for the '
         'AWE program was comparable as its operating profit in the first '
         'quarter of 2021 was mostly offset by accelerated amortization '
         'expense for intangible assets as a result of the renationalization. '
         'Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate '
         'adjustments, were $25 million lower in the first quarter of 2022 '
         'compared to the same period in 2021. Total equity earnings/(losses) '
         '(primarily ULA) represented approximately $30 million , or 12%, of '
         "Space's operating profit in the first quarter of 2022, compared to "
         'approximately $(5)\xa0million, or (2)%, in the first quarter of '
         "2021. Income Taxes The company's effective income tax rate was 15.9% "
         'and 16.9% for the quarters ended\xa0March\xa027, 2022 and March\xa0'
         '28, 2021. The rate for the first quarter of 2022 is lower due to '
         'increased tax deductions for employee equity awards and foreign '
         'derived intangible income compared to the first quarter of 2021.\xa0'
         'The rates for both periods also benefited from the research and '
         "development tax credit and dividends paid to the corporation's "

         'feature. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This news release '
         'contains the following non-generally accepted accounting principles '
         '(non-GAAP) financial measures (as defined by U.S. Securities and '
         'Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation G). While management believes '
         'that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating '
         'the financial performance of the company, this information should be '
         'considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial '
         'information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the '
         "company's definitions for non-GAAP financial measures may differ "
         'from similarly titled measures used by other companies or analysts. '
         'Business segment operating profit Business segment operating profit '
         "represents operating profit from the company's business segments "
         'before unallocated income and expense. This measure is used by the '
         "company's senior management in evaluating the performance of its "
         "business segments and is a performance goal in the company's annual "
         'incentive plan. Business segment operating margin is calculated by '
         'dividing business segment operating profit by sales. The table below '
         'reconciles the non-GAAP measure business segment operating profit '
         'with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, '
         'consolidated operating profit. (in millions)  Current 2022 Outlook '
         'Business segment operating profit (non-GAAP) ~$7,175 FAS/CAS '
         'operating adjustment 1 ~1,705 Other, net ~(500) Consolidated '
         'operating profit (GAAP) ~$8,380 1 Reflects the amount by which '
         'expected total CAS pension cost of $1.8 billion, exceeds the '
         'expected FAS pension service cost of $95 million. Excludes $555 '
         'million of expected non-service FAS pension income. Refer to the '
         'supplemental table "Selected Financial Data" included in this news '
         'release for a detail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. Free cash '
         'flow Free cash flow is cash from operations less capital '
         "expenditures. The company's capital expenditures are comprised of "
         'equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology '
         '(inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use '
         'software). The company uses free cash flow to evaluate its business '
         'performance and overall liquidity and is a performance goal in the '
         "company's annual and long-term incentive plans. The company believes "
         'free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it '
         'represents the amount of cash generated from operations after '
         'reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to '
         'stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchase and '
         'debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions. The entire free '
         'cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary '
         'expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain '
         'mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt. '
         'Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment – adjusted Total FAS/CAS pension '
         'adjustment for 2021 is used in one of the supplemental tables to '
         'this release. It has been adjusted for a noncash, non-operating '
         'pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion recognized in the third '
         'quarter of 2021. Management believes that the exclusion of the '
         'pension settlement charge related to the accelerated recognition of '
         'actuarial losses previously included in accumulated other '
         'comprehensive loss for certain pension plans as a result of the '
         'purchase of group annuity contracts from an insurance company, is '
         "useful to understanding the company's underlying business "
         'performance and comparing performance from period to period. '

         'African American officer to earn her second star in the U.S. Army '
         'reserves. When the former Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable '
         'Richard Spencer, directed that LCS 29 be named after the City of '
         'Beloit, he also asked that General Anderson be honored as the ship '
         'sponsor. “I am honored and excited to be a part of the christening '
         'and launch of the USS Beloit. As a Beloit native, I am well aware of '
         'the long history my city has had as it supported our national '
         'security by not just providing people who served, but also helped '

         'in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific resulting in hundreds of '
         'millions of dollars in narcotics seizures. Its speed, strength and '
         'versatility make it a critical tool to help sailors achieve their '
         'missions. Recently, the Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship for the '
         'first time has deployed to US 6th Fleet, as a measure of assurance '
         'for NATO allies and partners in Europe and Africa. LCS 29 is the '
         '15th Freedom-variant LCS and 29th in the LCS class. It is the first '

         "Guard's 130th Airlift Wing MARIETTA, Ga. , March 15, 2022 / "
         'PRNewswire / -- Hercules history is made once again, with the '
         'announcement that Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) recently delivered its '
         '500th C-130J Super Hercules airlifter. This Super Hercules (Lockheed '
         'Martin aircraft #5934) is a C-130J-30 aircraft assigned to the 130th '
         'Airlift Wing located at McLaughlin Air National Guard Base in '
         'Charleston, West Virginia . The 130th Airlift Wing is a longtime '
         'C-130 operator that is currently modernizing its legacy Hercules '
         'fleet with C-130Js.  The U.S. government operates the largest C-130J '
         'Super Hercules fleet in the world. This delivery represents the U.S. '
         "government's continued transition to the C-130J as the common "
         'platform across the Air Force, the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard. '
         '"This delivery represents the thousands of people — past and present '
         '— that design, build, fly, maintain and support C-130Js around the '
         'world," said Rod McLean , vice president and general manager of '
         "Lockheed Martin's Air Mobility & Maritime Missions (AMMM) line of "
         'business. "Like its namesake, the C-130J is a legend defined by its '
         'strength and power. Yet, it is the people who are part of the C-130J '
         'operator, production, supplier and industry partner communities who '
         'truly define the Super Hercules and helped the C-130J Program reach '
         'this monumental achievement." The C-130J Super Hercules is the '
         'current production model of the legendary C-130 Hercules aircraft. '
         'The airlift choice of 26 operators in 22 nations, the global C-130 '
         'fleet has surpassed more than 2 million flight hours and holds more '
         'than 54 world records. Defined by its versatility, there are 17 '
         'different mission configurations of the C-130J that includes '
         'transport (military and commercial), humanitarian aid delivery, '
         'aerial firefighting, natural disaster relief support, medevac, '
         'search and rescue, weather reconnaissance, and aerial refueling. As '
         'the most advanced C-130 ever produced, the C-130J-30 Super Hercules '
         '(which is 15 feet/4.6 m longer than legacy C-130 models) offers '

 'text': 'WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, New Mexico, March 29, 2022 – Today,\xa0'
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), the\xa0Missile Defense Agency '
         '(MDA)\xa0\xa0and the U.S. Army successfully further integrated the '
         'PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor into the '
         'Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Weapon System – '
         'resulting in a more tightly integrated, layered missile defense '
         'system. During a test today, the THAAD system successfully launched '
         'a PAC-3 MSE to intercept a tactical ballistic missile target using '
         'proven Hit-to-Kill technology without the support of a Patriot fire '
         'unit, yielding greater flexibility for the warfighter. Integration '
         'into the THAAD Weapon System allows the PAC-3 MSE to launch earlier, '
         'enabling a longer flyout and the full use of the MSE’s kinematic '
         'capability. “This integration is another Lockheed Martin '
         'contribution to joint all-domain operations and offers a critical '
         'capability in 21 st century security that gives the warfighter more '
         'options with existing equipment so they can choose the best '
         'interceptor for any threat they face,” said Scott Arnold, vice '
         'president, Integrated Air & Missile Defense at Lockheed Martin '
         'Missiles and Fire Control. The test also validates the flexibility '
         'of our PAC-3 missiles, which have now successfully launched from '
         'THAAD, Patriot and the U.S. Army’s Integrated Air and Missile '
         'Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) in flight tests. Several flight '
         'tests led to today’s integration of PAC-3 MSE within THAAD. In a '
         '2020 flight test , a PAC-3 MSE intercepted a target using data '
         'provided by THAAD. In an earlier test this year, the THAAD Weapon '
         'System launched a PAC-3 MSE interceptor against a virtual threat, '
         'demonstrating the successful integration of the PAC-3 MSE '
         'interceptor into the THAAD system. THAAD is the only U.S. system '
         'designed for endo-and exo-battlespace, using Hit-to-Kill technology '
         'to execute its lethal aim-point accuracy to intercept a threat with '
         'direct impact. PAC-3 MSE is an evolution of the battle-proven PAC-3 '
         'Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and also uses Hit-to-Kill technology '
         'to defend against threats through direct body-to-body contact that '
         'delivers exponentially more kinetic energy on the target than can be '
         'achieved with blast-fragmentation mechanisms. For additional '

         'satellite built by Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] for the National '
         'Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The satellite '
         "successfully launched from Florida's Space Coast at\xa04:38 p.m. "
         'ET.     "GOES-T\'s launch is the culmination of innovative '

         'Lockheed Martin," said Jagdeep Shergill , Lockheed Martin\'s GOES-R '
         'chief engineer and program manager. "With the impact climate change '

         'like GOES-T is more crucial than ever before, to help keep people '
         'safe now and in the future." GOES-T will be renamed GOES-18 when it '

         'West Coast of the United States . Advanced Monitoring of Weather, '
         'Oceans and Climate As climate change continues to drive more '

         'technology to put information in the hands of those who need it '
         'most, when they need it. Before it starts collecting and sharing '
         "critical weather data, the satellite's journey to space began in "
         'Littleton, Colorado , where it was designed and built by Lockheed '
         "Martin engineers. Based on Lockheed Martin's novel A2100 satellite "
         'bus design , the spacecraft features two high-tech instruments built '
         "by the company's Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California "
         ': Over its 10-year operational lifetime, GOES-T can produce over a '
         'terabyte of data per day and monitors severe weather continuously, '
         "supporting NOAA's mission to provide weather data to save lives. "
         "What's After Lift Off? Now that it's in space, GOES-T will undergo "
         'an on-orbit checkout of its instruments and systems before beginning '
         'official operations in January 2023 . In addition to severe weather '
         'monitoring, it will do things like: With three of the four GOES-R '
         'weather satellites now launched, GOES-U, the last satellite in the '
         'series, is in production and planned for a 2024 launch. Beyond the '
         'GOES-R series, Lockheed Martin looks forward to continued '
         'partnership with NASA and NOAA as they look ahead to future weather '
         'and climate missions. More About the Mission For over 50 years, '

 'text': 'LITTLETON , Colo., April 4, 2022 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has '
         'released an open-source, non-proprietary interface standard to '
         'support on-orbit docking within the industry. With unity of effort '
         'in mind, Lockheed Martin has published this Mission Augmentation '
         'Port (MAP) interface standard online to support industry approaches '
         'to on-orbit servicing and mission augmentation. Those interested in '
         'incorporating the standard in their space vehicles can download the '
         'necessary documents at www.LockheedMartin.com/MAP . The MAP standard '
         'provides a mechanical interface design for docking spacecraft to one '
         'another. Equipping satellites with docking adapters offers a novel '
         'way to add new mission capabilities to a platform after launch. '
         'Lockheed Martin’s own Augmentation System Port Interface (ASPIN) is '
         'designed to be compliant with the MAP standard. The ASPIN adapter '
         'provides electrical and data interface between a host spacecraft and '
         'a satellite augmentation vehicle (SAV). With this technology, we’re '
         'able to upgrade operational spacecraft at the speed of technology '
         'and provide built-in servicing infrastructure for spacecraft on '
         'orbit. The data released by Lockheed Martin can be used by designers '
         'to develop their own MAP-compliant docking adapters that will – '
         'barring some required discussion between servicers and hosts to '
         'coordinate missions – permit interoperability of docking satellites. '
         'Specifically, the documents released contain the information '
         'required for a compliant physical mate of docking port halves, such '
         'as the dimensions of plates and petals. While determined to be '
         'application specific, suggestions for electrical interfaces and '
         'docking profiles are included. “Just like USB was designed to '
         'standardize computer connections, these documents are designed to '
         'standardize how spacecraft connect to each other on orbit,” said '
         'Paul Pelley, Senior Director of Advanced Programs at Lockheed Martin '
         'Space. “We believe it’s in the best interest of the nation for the '
         'industry to have common interface standards to provide mission '
         'agility and enterprise interoperability.” Vision for On-Orbit '
         'Upgrades Much in the way we can now update missions on orbit using '
         'SmartSat™ to push software updates or load new apps, Lockheed Martin '
         'recognizes the need to reconfigure hardware capabilities to meet '
         'evolving mission needs. That’s where standards for docking come in: '
         'standardized docking interfaces allow satellite operators to unlock '
         'a new type of mission upgrades. Those upgrades are constrained only '
         'by the capabilities of the host satellite and the docking port '
         'interface, and could include processors, mass storage, or sensors '
         'that add longevity and value to missions. New mission capabilities '
         'can also be rapidly prototyped and tested on host spacecraft at a '
         'lower cost than traditional methods. Likewise, some satellite '
         'components can be replaced or upgraded after launch with new '
         'hardware. Unlike previous space missions where cutting-edge '
         'technology begins to lose relevance immediately after launch, future '
         'missions will be able to be upgraded via on-orbit hardware and '
         'software upgrades. What Lockheed Martin is envisioning goes beyond '
         '“filling up the tank” to extend mission life. The company believes '
         'its work will add real mission capability in a sustainable, '
         'cost-effective way. “Ultimately, our goal is to drive the '
         'development of a new ecosystem where a platform’s function can '
         'change at the pace of technology,” said Pelley. “This ecosystem will '
         'be made up of SAV providers, payload manufacturers, and others who '
         'will benefit from the on-orbit augmentation infrastructure.” For '

 'text': 'WEST PALM BEACH, Florida, April 4, 2022 – The Sikorsky RAIDER X® '
         'competitive prototype (CP) for the U.S. Army’s Future Attack '
         'Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) is more than 85 percent complete, '
         'progressing 50 percent faster through production and assembly '
         'compared to legacy programs and resulting in a cost-effective, '
         'transformational aircraft. Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company, has '
         'made significant progress on RAIDER X, which is now weight on wheels '
         'at the Sikorsky Development Flight Center in West Palm Beach, '
         'Florida. RAIDER X, which Sikorsky has begun powering on, has '
         'accomplished nearly 50 percent of required System Acceptance Test '
         'procedures. Sikorsky X2™ technology underpins the RAIDER X design. '
         'The compound coaxial technology of X2 provides unmatched potential '
         'and growth margin for increased speed, combat radius and payload. '
         'This enables a broader range of aircraft configurations for specific '
         'mission requirements. “Our transformational RAIDER X will deliver '
         'broad benefits to the Army including the lowest schedule risk and '
         'greatest technical maturity of the FARA competitors,” said Sikorsky '
         'President Paul Lemmo. “With X2 Technology, RAIDER X has the ability '
         'to grow, unlike a single-main rotor configuration. We’re looking to '
         'the future and we are committed to helping the Army deter threats '
         'and defend freedoms well into the 21 st century.” In addition, the '
         'build of Sikorsky’s second FARA fuselage is now complete. This '
         'fuselage is being integrated into Sikorsky’s structural test program '
         'and will be used to validate the flight and ground loads capability '
         'of the airframe.\xa0These tests support the RAIDER X CP flight '
         'safety program and provide data to optimize and accelerate the '
         'design for the full weapons system. “We took an innovative approach '
         'with our second CP fuselage,” said Sikorsky FARA Chief Engineer Pete '
         'Germanowski. “The second fuselage has not only increased the '
         'efficiency of the build and test of our first CP aircraft, it gives '
         'us the option to build it out as a second CP aircraft, providing us '
         'with more flexibility and greater risk reduction.” RAIDER X features '
         'Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA)-based avionics and mission '
         'systems offering “plug-and-play” options for computing, sensors, '
         'survivability and weapons. X2 compound coaxial technology provides '
         'unmatched potential and growth margin for increased speed, combat '
         'radius and payload. This enables a broader range of aircraft '
         'configurations for specific mission requirements. “The FARA mission '
         'requires operational flexibility, and RAIDER X provides that '
         'operational flexibility the Army needs including speed where it '
         'matters, a large multi-functional weapons bay and unprecedented '
         'acceleration and deceleration capability,” said Jay Macklin, '
         'Sikorsky business development director. “RAIDER X is the most agile, '

 'text': 'NASHVILLE March 31, 2022 — After three years of proving its '
         'transformational flight capabilities, the Lockheed Martin '
         'Sikorsky-Boeing SB>1 DEFIANT® helicopter arrived in Nashville this '
         'week to give U.S. Army Aviators a first-hand look at this impressive '
         'aircraft at the Army Aviation Association of America’s annual '
         'summit. Army aviators at the summit will be able to see how Team '
         'DEFIANT is revolutionizing Future Vertical Lift, one of the Army’s '
         'top modernization priorities, with a focus on transforming the '
         'Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program’s capabilities, '
         'production and sustainment resulting in lower-life cycle costs. The '
         'result is DEFIANT X® a complete weapon system that builds on the '
         'handling qualities and capabilities proven by the team’s technology '
         'demonstrator, SB>1 DEFIANT®. “When Sikorsky and Boeing embarked on '
         'the DEFIANT journey, we were mission focused and thinking ahead to '
         'creating a holistic weapon system that would give America’s Soldiers '
         'a strategic advantage to deter and defeat threats well into the 21 '
         'st century,” said Sikorsky President Paul Lemmo. “DEFIANT ensures '
         'our aviators are confident and prepared for what’s ahead and gives '
         'them the agility to adapt to evolving threats.” “This monumental '
         'flight further proves the maturity of the DEFIANT design and that it '
         'is ready to support the Army’s future long-range assault missions,” '
         'said Mark Cherry, Boeing Vice President and General Manager of '
         'Vertical Lift. “Just as SB>1 DEFIANT flew safely over multiple '
         'states from Florida to Tennessee, DEFIANT X will safely fly and meet '
         'all of our customer’s objectives.” Sikorsky’s Bill Fell and Boeing’s '
         'Ed Henderscheid piloted SB>1 DEFIANT’s momentous 700-nautical miles '
         'trip from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Nashville. This is the first '
         'time the helicopter has traveled outside of the state of Florida. '
         '“On the trip from West Palm Beach to Nashville, DEFIANT used less '
         'than 50 percent of the engine power available and less than 50 '
         'percent of the propulsor torque,” Fell said. “There’s a lot more '
         'that this machine has to offer. This is the future of Army '
         'aviation.” “DEFIANT behaved flawlessly. Fuel burn was at or even '
         'less than what we expected,” Henderscheid said. “This 700-nautical '
         'mile trip is the culmination of three years of hard work on this '
         'program.” Also this week, Team DEFIANT announced the newest members '
         'of its team: The team previously announced that Honeywell will '

 'text': 'DENVER, Feb. 15, 2022 – Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] was awarded '
         'three NASA contracts for key elements of the agency’s visionary Mars '
         'Sample Return program. The first contract is for the cruise stage '
         'that will power and steer the Mars-bound journey of the lander that '
         'retrieves Martian rock and soil samples from the Perseverance Rover. '
         'For this $35 million award from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in '
         'Southern California (JPL), Lockheed Martin will produce the cruise '
         'stage and its comprehensive elements, including the solar arrays, '
         'structure, propulsion and thermal properties. The second is for the '
         'Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), the lightweight rocket that will launch '
         'sediment and atmospheric samples from the surface of the Red Planet, '
         'as they head back to Earth for study. Under the $194 million '
         'contract from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, Lockheed Martin '
         'will design, build, test and deliver the rocket – which will be the '
         'first ever to lift off from the surface of another planet. The third '
         'contract, through JPL, is for the Earth Entry System. Leveraging '
         'government research, the system is designed to bring those first '
         'ever samples safely back to Earth in a protective case. This initial '
         '$2.6 million award includes preliminary design of the structure that '
         'shields the samples as they make their bold return journey through '
         'Earth’s atmosphere. "We’re thrilled to partner with NASA on these '
         'important elements of NASA’s ambitious Mars Sample Return campaign,” '
         'said Lisa Callahan, Lockheed Martin’s vice president and general '
         'manager of the company’s Commercial Civil Space business. “It’s a '
         'great responsibility to be entrusted to solve the technical '
         'challenges of this groundbreaking mission. We’re looking forward to '
         'helping NASA blaze new trails in scientific discovery.” Cruising to '
         'the Red Planet In the mission architecture being planned by NASA and '
         'the European Space Agency, the Lockheed Martin-built cruise stage '
         'will propel a lander to the Red Planet, where that lander will touch '
         'down and collect Martian soil samples cached by the Perseverance '
         'rover. To avoid seasonal dust storms, this journey to Mars will take '
         'about 28 months. The cruise stage is critical for power, '
         'communication and steering the spacecraft throughout its journey. '
         'The cruise stage is comprised of a complex network of wiring, '
         'propulsion tanks and powered elements that are integrated with the '
         'aeroshell , which shield the spacecraft as it enters Mars’ '
         'atmosphere. The directional control the cruise stage provides is '
         'also vital when it comes to ensuring the future lander enters Mars’ '
         'atmosphere at the correct point. Liftoff From the Martian Surface '
         'This lander that touches down on the Red Planet will bring the '
         'ascent vehicle along with it to the surface. Once the lander '
         'retrieves samples from Perseverance, the MAV will then launch those '
         'contained samples into Martian orbit for rendezvous with a European '
         'Space Agency orbiter that has the Lockheed Martin-built sample '
         'return capsule inside. The Martian rock samples will then be stowed '
         'in that container, which is jettisoned once the orbiter returns to '
         'the proximity of Earth. Earth’s gravitational pull takes the capsule '
         'back through the atmosphere, where it will experience thousands of '
         'degrees of heat and intense forces before its soft desert landing. '
         'Returning Safely to Earth Lockheed Martin has designed and built '
         'return capsules and spacecraft for all three of NASA’s robotic '
         'sample return missions – Genesis, Stardust and OSIRIS-Rex. This '
         'extensive experience has allowed the company’s engineers to '

 'text': 'Dallas, tx ., March 7, 2022 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company '
         '[NYSE: LMT] together with GE Aviation and Milestone Aviation, '
         'announce the S-92® helicopter arrived at HAI HELI-EXPO 2022 using a '
         'blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The helicopter utilized a '
         'combination of biofuel, as well as traditional jet fuel in the 1500 '
         'mile cross country flight. “As a Corporation, we are committed to '
         'sustainability and I am proud that our S-92 helicopter is playing a '
         'role in a more sustainable future,” said Jason Lambert, Sikorsky’s '
         'vice president of Global Commercial and Military Systems. “The '
         'aircraft is known for its unmatched advantages and the use of '
         'biofuel is one more attribute on that list.” Sikorsky continues to '
         'look for opportunities across its fleet to utilize Sustainable '
         'Aviation Fuel and take steps to meet environmental challenges. GE is '
         'committed decarbonization efforts in the aviation industry,” said '
         'Harry Nahatis, vice president and general manager for GE turboshaft '

         'toward decarbonization, and we’re proud to not only support our '
         'customers at Sikorsky and Milestone Aviation for this SAF flight, '
         'but also to be actively involved in assessing and qualifying SAF for '
         'widespread use in the industry. GE has performed extensive testing, '
         'including the industry’s first commercial biofuel demonstration '
         'flight in 2008, and the first 100 percent SAF commercial airliner '
         'flight in 2018. All GE and GE partnership engines in service today — '
         'and in the future — can operate with approved SAF. Pat Sheedy, '
         'President & CEO, Milestone Aviation, said, “We are very pleased to '
         'be part of this important initiative with our long-time partners at '
         'Sikorsky and GE Aviation, and to support them in meeting their '
         'commitment to sustainability. This is the first SAF-powered flight '

 'text': 'DALLAS, March 8, 2022 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: '
         'LMT), and United Rotorcraft, a division of Air Methods Corporation, '
         'today signed a marketing teaming agreement that formalizes how both '
         'companies will collaborate to meet growing global interest in the '
         'S-70™ FIREHAWK® helicopter . The agreement will enable the team to '
         'identify demand, and more quickly build and configure new production '
         'FIREHAWK helicopters for government agencies worldwide that require '
         'a highly effective solution to attack increasingly deadly wildland '
         'fires. “This agreement addresses a critical need to deliver the '
         'proven FIREHAWK helicopter into customer hands in months not years,” '
         'said Jason Lambert, vice president, Sikorsky Global Commercial & '
         'Military Systems. “United Rotorcraft and Air Methods have taken a '
         'leadership position to advance the availability of this proven '
         'aircraft in anticipation of future orders from U.S. and '
         'international markets. This proactive approach is one that we '
         'readily support to meet future demand. Doing so also honors our '
         'founder Igor Sikorsky, whose vision that the helicopter be a unique '
         'instrument for saving human lives continues to be fulfilled.” The '
         'agreement will allow United Rotorcraft to contract for bulk orders '
         'of S-70 Black Hawk® aircraft, much as it did in August 2021 with an '
         'initial five-aircraft order from Sikorsky. Four of the five aircraft '
         'will arrive at United Rotorcraft’s Englewood, Colorado completions '
         'facility this year from the S-70 production line at PZL Mielec, a '
         'Lockheed Martin company in Poland. The first aircraft of the bulk '
         'order will be modified to the FIREHAWK configuration for delivery in '
         '2023 to the State of Colorado. “The success of the Firehawk '
         'helicopter in California to attack and suppress wildfires in their '
         'initial stage has spurred fire agencies globally to evaluate this '
         'unique asset, both as a firefighting tool and a multi-mission '
         'aircraft for year-round rescue and medical assistance,” said Larry '
         'Alexandre, United Rotorcraft president. “Federal, state and local '
         'legislatures facing wildfire threats are more likely to authorize an '
         'aircraft purchase if the aircraft is readily available. With '
         'Sikorsky’s assistance as aircraft manufacturer, United Rotorcraft '
         'and Air Methods are bringing the world’s most efficient medium lift '
         'firefighting helicopter to the market at a speed not previously '
         'seen.” An S-70 BLACK HAWK aircraft becomes a FIREHAWK helicopter '
         'when United Rotorcraft adds a 1,000-gallon (3,785-liter) water tank '
         'system, a raised landing gear (to accommodate the tank), and '
         'associated integrated avionics, a process that typically takes six '
         'months. United Rotorcraft has been the FIREHAWK completion teammate '
         'of Sikorsky since the late 1990s working closely with Sikorsky and '
         'first customer County of Los Angeles Fire Department, which today '
         'operates two S-70i™ and three S-70A™ FIREHAWK aircraft. Other '
         'operators include CAL FIRE and the City of San Diego Fire-Rescue. '
         'United Rotorcraft recently introduced a digital control mode that '
         'gives either pilot greater control of water released to suit the '
         'type of fire, and in 2023 will offer both the currently available '
         'aluminum tank and a new lightweight, composite tank option. For more '

 'text': 'LITTLETON, Colo., March 1, 2022 -- Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has '
         'selected Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: RTX) to provide a '
         'second mission payload for the Next Generation Overhead Persistent '
         'Infrared Geosynchronous Earth Orbit Block 0 missile warning '
         'satellite system – also known as NGG. Both Raytheon Technologies and '
         'Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) are each already on '
         'contract to provide one mission payload for the three-satellite '
         'procurement. Lockheed Martin is currently under contract with the '
         'United States Space Force (U.S.S.F.) Space Systems Command (SSC) to '
         'build three survivable NGG satellites with enhanced missile warning '
         'and resiliency capabilities to stay ahead of the emerging threats. '
         'As part of risk-reduction efforts to meet the U.S.S.F.’s imperative '
         'to launch the first satellite by 2025, Lockheed Martin selected '
         'Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman/Ball Aerospace to develop '
         'mission payload designs. The payload designs from both competitors '
         'have completed the critical design phase and are on track to fly on '
         'the first two NGG satellites. It has yet to be determined which '
         'payload will be aboard the first NGG satellite launched in 2025. '
         '“For this ‘Go-Fast’ program, both teams had to meet stringent '
         'schedule and performance requirements – which they’ve done. I want '
         'to congratulate and thank both teams for their tireless work and we '
         'look forward to the first flights of both the mission payloads,” '
         'said Joseph Rickers, Lockheed Martin’s NGG program vice president. '
         '“These advanced OPIR payloads will support the critical mission by '
         'leveraging technologies with new capabilities on an aggressive '
         'schedule.” For this rapid acquisition program, both competitive '
         'payload teams were selected and placed under contract just 45 days '
         'after the prime contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin in 2018. '
         'Aiming to have their advanced payloads eventually integrated into '
         'Lockheed Martin’s resilient LM2100 Combat Bus™ space vehicle, the '
         'teams quickly completed preliminary design reviews in 2020 and '
         'critical design reviews in 2021. Both teams successfully completed '

 'text': 'BETHESDA, Md. , Jan. 31, 2022 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE: LMT) leaders announced today the LMXT strategic tanker '
         'aircraft will be manufactured in Mobile, Alabama , and Marietta, '
         'Georgia . Introduced in September 2021 , the LMXT is Lockheed '
         'Martin\'s offering for the U.S. Air Force\'s KC-Y "Bridge Tanker" '
         'Program competition. "Establishing this production work in Alabama '
         "and Georgia confirms Lockheed Martin's commitment that the LMXT will "
         'be built in America, by Americans, for Americans," said Lockheed '
         'Martin Chairman, President, and CEO James Taiclet . "The LMXT will '
         'strengthen global security by enabling our U.S. service members to '
         'carry out their most critical missions at extended ranges. At home, '
         'the LMXT will strengthen job growth and manufacturing by drawing on '
         'the experience and talents of a high-tech American workforce in two '
         'states that are proven leaders in aviation."     The LMXT represents '
         "the newest chapter in Lockheed Martin's 60-plus year history of "
         'producing and delivering tanker and large aircraft for the U.S. Air '
         'Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy and multiple operators around '
         'the world. Built on the combat-proven design of the\xa0Airbus A330 '
         'Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), the LMXT leverages known '
         'performance and capability insights from the strategic tanker of '
         'choice used by 14 nations around the world to currently refuel '
         'fighter, transport and maritime patrol aircraft for the U.S. and '
         'allied partners. "Over our 50-year history in the U.S., some of our '
         'proudest moments have come from supporting our American service '
         'members," said C. Jeffrey Knittel , chairman and CEO of Airbus '
         'Americas. "Our U.S. workforce, which is more than 35% military '
         'veterans, is eager to see an Air Force tanker join the fleet of '
         'Airbus aircraft flying for the U.S. Army, National Guard, Navy and '
         'Coast Guard." With Lockheed Martin as the prime contractor, the LMXT '
         'will be built in two phases: Lockheed Martin and Airbus entered into '
         'a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in 2018 to explore aerial-refueling '
         'solutions to address any refueling capacity shortfalls for the U.S. '
         'Air Force, with the MRTT at the center of its discussions. The LMXT '
         'is a result of this MOA, offering a proven airframe with distinct '
         'U.S. Air Force-only capabilities built by a highly skilled American '
         'workforce in two states that lead the nation in aerospace '
         'manufacturing. The expansion of work by both Lockheed Martin and '
         'Airbus in Alabama and Georgia is a natural progression for the '
         'companies, with each having deep roots in both states. Lockheed '
         "Martin's presence in northern Alabama spans more than five decades, "
         'with a concentration in the rotorcraft and hypersonics sectors. More '
         'than 2,600 Lockheed Martin employees live and work in Alabama . In '
         'October 2021 , Lockheed Martin opened an advanced production '
         'facility in Courtland focused on hypersonic strike production. More '
         'than 5,000 Lockheed Martin employees support work at its Aeronautics '
         'facility in Marietta as well as in other facilities in Macon and '
         "Kings Bay . A leader in Georgia's aerospace industry, Lockheed "
         "Martin's Marietta facility has produced some of the most well-known "
         'military aircraft since 1951 to include every production C-130 '
         'Hercules (2,600-plus), the C-5 Galaxy/Super Galaxy, the P-3 Orion, '
         'the F-22 Raptor and the C-141 Starlifter. More than 4,500 employees '
         "currently work at the site. Lockheed Martin's economic impact across "
         'Alabama and Georgia totals more than $8.3 billion annually to '
         'include total sales, supplier dollars, employee payroll, taxes and '
         'charitable donations. More than 630 suppliers across both states '
         'support Lockheed Martin programs. In 2020, Lockheed Martin '
         'Aeronautics contributed more than $2.6 million in both states '
         'supporting military, education and community-based organizations. '
         'Airbus has been assembling commercial aircraft in Mobile since 2015, '
         'and in just the first five years of operation had a total economic '
         'impact in Alabama of $1.2 billion and more than 15,000 jobs, through '
         'construction and payroll alone. Airbus is also engaged with more '
         'than 40 local charitable and civic organizations in the region, '
         'investing both time and money in the local community. The LMXT '
         'offers a proven airframe with distinct U.S. Air Force-only '
         'capabilities designed to meet operator requirements, with advantages '

 'text': 'LITTLETON , Col., Feb. 28, 2022 – The Space Development Agency (SDA) '
         'has awarded Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) a prototype agreement with a '
         'potential value of approximately $700 million to design and build 42 '
         'small satellites. These satellites are part of Tranche 1, the '
         'initial warfighting capability of the agency’s Transport Layer, '
         'which will connect space with other domains on Earth in a highly '
         'capable, networked environment of Joint All-Domain Operations. “This '
         'innovative mesh network of small satellites will link terrestrial '
         'warfighting domains to space sensors, allowing warfighters much '
         'faster access to data so they can stay ahead of emerging threats,” '
         'said Erik Daehler, protected communications mission area leader at '
         'Lockheed Martin Space. “Through our Agility Partners Marketplace, we '
         'have multiple vendors on contract who can build common components '
         'without disruptions to cost or schedule – that’s key to getting this '
         'needed capability on orbit.” As part of this tranche, SDA is '
         'developing a prototype constellation of up to 126 space vehicles '
         'divided into six orbital planes. Lockheed Martin will develop 42 of '
         'those space vehicles for the Transport Layer constellation, which '
         'will provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and '
         'connectivity worldwide to a full range of warfighter platforms using '
         'Link-16 antennas and laser Optical Intersatellite Links. "SDA is '
         'changing the landscape for acquisition of national defense space '
         'capabilities by capitalizing on a unique business model that '
         'harnesses commercial development to achieve a proliferated low Earth '
         'orbit architecture that enhances resilience and lowers latency to '
         'process and move data from sensor to shooter,” said SDA Director '
         'Derek Tournear. “The per satellite price, volume, and speed of '
         'delivery represented by the T1TL agreements signed with our partners '
         'demonstrate industry’s progress toward building a strong '
         'marketplace.” Lockheed Martin’s Agility Partners Marketplace is a '
         'network of suppliers and teammates, including Tyvak, TESAT, and '
         'Innoflight. Having multiple component suppliers ensures that parts '
         'are available despite supply chain challenges encountered in today’s '
         'operating environment. Lockheed Martin’s approach to high-rate '
         'production eliminates chokepoints by quickly isolating problems on '
         'vehicles without stopping the work on other satellites. The '
         'combination of these approaches will help keep SDA’s aggressive '
         'delivery schedule on-time and on-budget. Building on Success of '
         'Tranche 0 Lockheed Martin’s Tranche 1 agreement builds upon the '
         'company’s success on Tranche 0 , where it is on-track to deliver 10 '
         'space vehicles later this year. Tranche 0 represents the first step '
         'toward building an interoperable, connected secure mesh network. On '
         'orbit, it can enable Joint All-Domain Operations by linking nodes '
         'together, creating seamless connectivity between all domains. '
         'Initially, the Tranche 0 constellation is expected to have a limited '
         'networked capability, but future enhancements from Tranche 1 and '
         'beyond will significantly increase the routing of data across a '
         'larger network of space vehicles. Satellite Capabilities The '
         'constellation will also have the capability to integrate with '
         'Link-16 and Tactical Communications. This integration on the '
         'Transport Layer will modernize current capabilities to better '
         'support warfighter needs for worldwide, timely threat warning and '
         'situational awareness information across a range of military '
         'operations. Link-16 will connect to systems that include fighter '
         'aircraft like F-16, F-22, and F-35 and integrated air and missile '

 'text': 'ANNAPOLIS JUNCTION, MD, Feb. 16, 2022 – The U.S. Department of '
         'Defense (DOD) has awarded Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) a $19.3 '
         'million Prototype Project Agreement (PPA) to create a 5G '
         'communications network infrastructure testbed for expeditionary '
         'operations experimentation for the Office of the Under Secretary of '
         'Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E) and the U.S. Marine '
         'Corps. The testbed, known as Open Systems Interoperable and '
         'Reconfigurable Infrastructure Solution (OSIRIS), is a key initiative '
         'of Lockheed Martin’s 5G.MIL ® programs which are positioned to help '
         'its customers field, scale and integrate 5G technology rapidly and '
         'affordably across all operations on land, water, in air, space and '
         'cyber. “OSIRIS will serve as a critical proof point of Lockheed '
         'Martin’s 5G.MIL ® capabilities,” says Deon Viergutz, vice president, '
         'Lockheed Martin Spectrum Convergence. “We are integrating the '
         'technical capabilities of 5G waveforms, software and hardware with '
         'higher bandwidth and low-latency data rates into our defense '
         'products to enhance their performance for our warfighters. We want '
         'to ensure that warfighters operating in communications contested and '
         'denied environments have resilient access to data to perform their '
         'missions anywhere in the world.” The OSIRIS program will help '
         'address the need for test facilities that enable rapid '
         'experimentation and dual-use application prototyping.\xa0The testbed '
         'will identify areas for further compatibility between 5G network and '
         'DOD platforms that will enhance customer capabilities.\xa0 The '
         'infrastructure will also allow for the connection of various '
         '5G-ready user devices, sensors, vehicles and endpoints to explore '
         'the military utility of commercial 5G technologies and pave the way '
         'for onboarding of new technologies from other OUSD investments while '
         'addressing cybersecurity requirements. This capability will further '
         'enable and advance DOD’s Joint All Domain Operations concept. Teams '
         'from Lockheed Martin, along with subcontractors DISH Wireless, Intel '
         'Corporation, Radisys Corporation and Rampart Communications, Inc., '
         'will create the 5G network testbed infrastructure at U.S. Marine '
         'Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The period of performance will begin '
         "immediately and conclude in September 2024. Lockheed Martin's recent "
         'agreements with Radisys, Verizon and Keysight Technologies are '
         "significant enablers in furthering the DOD's new warfighting "
         'concepts. Through collaboration with commercial companies and '
         'leveraging its industry experience, Lockheed Martin’s 5G.MIL '
         "programs support the chairman, president and CEO Jim Taiclet's "
         'vision to achieve network effects by bridging commercial '
         'technologies into future DOD capabilities that enable JADO and Joint '
         'All Domain Command and Control to meet our customer’s and partner’s '

         'Acquisition Earlier this month, Lockheed Martin and Aerojet '
         'Rocketdyne agreed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that the '
         'parties would not close the transaction before Jan. 27, 2022 , to '
         'enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant '
         'supply and firewall commitments previously offered by Lockheed '
         'Martin. Lockheed Martin has been advised by the FTC that its '
         'concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by '
         'the terms of a consent order. Lockheed Martin believes it is highly '
         'likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and '
         'expects they will make a decision before Jan. 27, 2022 . If the FTC '
         'sues to block the transaction, Lockheed Martin could elect to defend '

         'retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset '
         'impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, and other '
         'miscellaneous corporate activities. The company recovers CAS pension '
         'cost through the pricing of its products and services on U.S. '
         'Government contracts and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension cost in '
         "each of its business segments' net sales and cost of sales. The "
         "company's consolidated financial statements must present pension and "
         'other postretirement benefit plan income calculated in accordance '
         'with FAS requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting '
         'principles. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension '
         'adjustment represents the difference between the service cost '

         'included in other non-service FAS pension (expense) income in our '

         'adjustment increases or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total '
         'FAS pension income (both service and non-service). Changes in net '
         'sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of '
         'volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales '
         'or operating profit resulting from varying production activity '
         'levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume '
         'changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the '
         'current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, '
         "comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and "
         'operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes '
         "in profit booking rates on the company's contracts for which it "
         'recognizes revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion '
         'cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. '
         'Increases in profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk '
         'retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total '
         'costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved '
         'conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a '
         'particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the '
         'estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a '
         'reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in '
         'profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and '
         'reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment '
         'operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or '
         'unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. '
         'Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual '
         'matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, '
         'insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items '
         'may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; '
         'restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions '
         'which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for '

         'company cannot predict how the pandemic will evolve or what impact '
         'it will continue to have. Therefore, no additional impacts to the '
         "Company's operations or its supply chain as a result of continued "
         'disruption from, or policies in response to, COVID-19 for periods '
         'subsequent to the time of this news release have been incorporated '

         "impacts of COVID-19 on the company's financial outlook for 2022 and "

         'business performance and comparing performance from period to '
         'period. Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow is cash from operations less '
         'capital expenditures. The company uses free cash flow to evaluate '
         'its business performance and overall liquidity. The company believes '
         'free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it '
         'represents the amount of cash generated from operations after '
         'reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to '
         'stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchase and '
         'debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions. The entire free '
         'cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary '
         'expenditures. Cash from operations (excluding R&D ) Cash from '
         'operations (excluding R&D) is cash from operations excluding the '
         'impact of a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 related '
         'to research and development costs that went into effect on Jan. 1, '
         '2022 . The provision requires that companies capitalize and amortize '
         'research and development costs over five years for tax purposes '
         'rather than deducting such costs in the year incurred. The company '
         'believes this adjusted measure of cash from operations is useful to '
         'investors because it allows for a comparison against prior periods '
         "of the company's ability to generate cash controlling for the change "
         'in tax law, and because the impact of the new tax law will lessen '
         'over the course of the five-year amortization period and become '
         'immaterial in the sixth year. Conference Call Information Lockheed '

         'operators to interact with Callisto from the Mission Control Center. '
         'These remote interactions will test and demonstrate how voice and '
         'video collaboration technologies can help astronauts improve '
         'efficiency and situational awareness during their mission, providing '
         'access to flight status and telemetry, and the ability to control '
         'connected devices onboard Orion. Video and audio of the interactions '
         'will be transmitted back to Earth many times throughout the Artemis '
         'I mission, allowing engineers to analyze the performance of the '
         'onboard systems while also sharing interactions with the public. '
         '"The future of technology is about igniting human potential whenever '
         'and wherever that may be – which will soon extend to the depths of '
         'space," said Jeetu Patel , executive vice president and general '
         'manager of Security and Collaboration at Cisco. "Through Callisto, '
         'Webex is enabling boundless video communications and collaboration '
         'in deep space while helping to provide the next generation with '
         'inclusive and immersive technology. This first-of-its-kind solution '
         'could one day support future crewed missions, providing face-to-face '
         'interaction between crew, command center and loved ones." The '
         'Callisto technology demonstration will also allow students, '
         'families, space enthusiasts and the general public to engage with '
         'and virtually "ride along" with the Artemis I mission. They can '
         'follow the mission on Alexa-enabled devices by saying "Alexa, take '
         'me to the Moon," and the Webex video collaboration capabilities will '

 'text': 'KOUROU, French Guiana , Dec. 25, 2021 / PRNewswire / -- With the '
         "liftoff of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope from French Guiana "
         'today, humankind is one step closer to seeing the universe in a '
         'whole new light, with help from a camera built by Lockheed Martin '
         '[NYSE: LMT]. The instrument will be key in giving the telescope its '
         'first glimpse of celestial light.     The Near Infrared Camera '
         "(NIRCam) is Webb's primary imager and one of the most sensitive "
         'infrared cameras ever built. As the telescope sets itself up in '
         "space, NIRCam will help align Webb's intricate array of mirrors. It "
         'will then take science images throughout the entire mission. '
         '"NIRCam\'s journey is over two decades in the making, and seeing it '
         'lift off into space on Webb was the culmination of many years of '
         'hard work with Marcia Rieke and our University of Arizona partners," '
         "said Alison Nordt , Lockheed Martin's space science and "
         'instrumentation director, who led development of NIRCam. "Webb will '
         'rewrite the science books of how we understand our universe, and to '
         'have Lockheed Martin-built technology help advance the future of '
         'space imaging is an honor." The Lockheed Martin and University of '
         "Arizona team designed, built and tested NIRCam out of the company's "
         'Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California . How to Look at '
         "the Universe's Oldest Light Webb is designed to peer at the "
         "universe's oldest light, which scientists believe occurred around "
         '13.5 billion years ago. As the universe expands, those light waves '
         'that were once visible have now shifted into the infrared spectrum. '
         'This light is incredibly far away and extremely dim, which is why '
         "Webb requires large mirrors – along with NIRCam's ultra-precise "
         "optics – to see it. Before that can happen, NIRCam's first job is to "
         'sense incoming infrared light and take images that will help the '
         "telescope's systems properly align its 18 primary mirror segments. "
         'This is critical to ensuring Webb provides crystal clear images once '
         "it enters science mode. The Technology Behind NIRCam For Webb's "
         "mirror alignment in early 2022, NIRCam senses what's called a "
         '"wavefront," or an ideally perfect sphere of light particles emitted '
         'from any luminescent object. When those particles encounter another '
         "object – in this case, the telescope's optics – they become "
         'distorted. NIRCam measures those distortions with nanometric '
         "accuracy, and that data is then used to advise how Webb's mirrors "
         "must adjust. This iterative process is done until the telescope's "
         'mirrors are properly aligned. With Webb traveling more than 1 '
         'million miles from Earth into space, NIRCam must function with '
         'extreme precision and stability in temperatures as cold as -400°F. '
         'In fact, the telescope needs frigid temperatures to ensure infrared '
         "radiating off the observatory doesn't overwhelm the images. To "
         'enable operations in such extreme conditions, Lockheed Martin '
         "developed a new technique for bonding NIRCam's optical lenses to "
         'their mounts. The innovative method ensures the cold and launch '
         "vibrations don't cause shifts in alignment of NIRCam's lenses. After "
         'more than a decade of meticulous engineering and rigorous testing, '
         'the team delivered one of the most capable infrared instruments ever '
         'created, and NIRCam was fully integrated onto Webb in 2014. Now, the '
         'telescope gets situated for a decade of ground-breaking observations '
         'to shape how we see space for years to come. More About the Mission '
         "The Webb Space Telescope is the world's newest premier space science "
         'observatory. It will solve mysteries in our solar system, look '
         'beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the '
         'mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in '
         'it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners – '
         'the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency – and '

         'development of critical capabilities like 5G-enabled wireless relay '
         'and Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB). Wireless relay to global '
         'network infrastructure is an important part of tactical '
         'communication when warfighters operate in places where wired '
         'interconnections are not possible or are cost prohibitive. The pace '

 'text': 'CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 17, 2021 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'announced today it is directing $9 million U.S. dollars toward TC '
         'Energy’s Saddlebrook Solar + Storage Project. The investment, in '
         'conjunction with Emissions Reduction Alberta partial funding, '
         'enables TC Energy, a Canada-based energy infrastructure company, to '
         'construct a hybrid power plant consisting of a utility-scale solar '
         'facility and long-duration flow battery energy storage system in '
         'Alberta. This pilot project is expected to be the largest flow '
         'battery energy storage facility in Alberta and will aid the region’s '
         'sustainability and decarbonization efforts. Lockheed Martin’s '
         'investment, under Canada’s Industrial and Technological Benefits '
         '(ITB) Policy, is one of many made across Canada associated with '
         'Canada’s purchase and in-service support of 17 CC-130J Super '
         'Hercules aircraft, delivered to the Royal Canadian Air Force from '
         '2010 through 2012. The investment exemplifies how defense '
         'procurement projects serve as a catalyst for innovation, critical '
         'research and development. "In addition to supporting Canada’s '
         'national security interests, our teams are focused on partnerships '
         'and collaboration that secure a brighter future through investments '
         'that will play a central role in Canada’s economic stability and '
         'provide for growth in the decades ahead,” said Lorraine Ben, chief '
         'executive, Lockheed Martin Canada. “We’re proud to bring this '
         'sustainable energy project to life with TC Energy." The Saddlebrook '
         'Solar + Storage Project consists of a solar generating facility that '
         'uses bifacial solar panels to generate power. The installation is '
         'expected to provide up to 102.5 megawatts (MW) of solar power, which '
         'can create enough electricity to fuel approximately 30,000 homes. '
         'Lockheed Martin has also entered a teaming agreement with TC Energy '
         'to provide the project with its long-duration GridStar ® Flow energy '
         'storage system. This system is expected to have an output capacity '
         'of up to 6.5 MW and output duration of up to eight hours. The '
         'project will use GridStar Flow to store power generated from the '
         'solar farm and dispatch it to Alberta’s electricity system in times '
         'of peak demand. Together, the solar installation and GridStar Flow '
         'are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants '
         'by providing reliable, emissions-free energy to the grid. " Energy '
         'storage is the key to unlocking the full potential of renewable '
         'energy and aiding in decarbonizing Alberta’s electricity grid," '
         'said\xa0Corey Hessen, TC Energy senior vice-president and president, '
         'Power, Storage & Commercial Marketing. "This investment represents a '
         'significant contribution and we’re looking forward to advancing this '
         'innovative pilot project.” Additionally, the University of Calgary, '
         'Lockheed Martin and TC Energy are working together to perform '
         'research on the Saddlebrook Solar + Storage Project to demonstrate '
         'the effectiveness of a large-scale solar plus storage generation '
         'facility and inform similar sustainable energy projects across '
         'Canada. “In collaboration with Lockheed Martin and TC Energy, our '
         'researchers will conduct ground-breaking energy research in pursuit '
         'of shared sustainability goals,” said Dr. William Ghali, vice '
         'president, research at the University of Calgary. “This partnership '
         'ensures UCalgary will continue to be a leader in transforming the '
         'energy landscape for a cleaner, more efficient future.” This '
         'innovative project has also been awarded $10 million in Cash '
         'Available for Distribution funding through the Emissions Reduction '
         'Alberta Biotechnology, Electricity, & Sustainable Transportation\xa0 '

 'text': 'Warsaw, POLAND, NOVEMBER 22 , 2021 – PZL Mielec, a Lockheed Martin '
         'company and one of Poland’s longest established aircraft '
         'manufacturers, is to be a manufacturing partner for one of the '
         'world’s most successful fighter aircraft programs. Beginning next '
         'year, PZL Mielec will build components and assemblies for the latest '
         'generation F-16 Block 70/72, sustaining around 200 jobs, with '
         'approximately 60 new jobs being created. This development marks a '
         'significant new milestone for PZL Mielec, which was last involved in '
         'the production of fighter aircraft in the 1960s. Beginning next '
         'year, PZL Mielec will manufacture the rear fuselage, center '
         'fuselage, cockpit structure, cockpit side panel and forward '
         'equipment bay for new production F-16s, exporting the aerostructures '
         'to Lockheed Martin’s final assembly line in Greenville, South '
         'Carolina. “Today’s announcement underlines our commitment to PZL '

         'relationship and helped enable today’s exciting announcement.” With '
         'orders already secured for the F-16 Block 70/72 from five customers, '
         'global interest remains high for new-build production aircraft and '
         'for F-16V upgrades. Poland has operated F-16s in its own fleet for '
         'the past 15 years, and this summer marked a 100,000 flight-hour '
         'milestone. “The F-16 remains a critical part of the Polish Air '
         'Force,” says Danya Trent, Lockheed Martin vice president, F-16 '
         'program. “This new production work at PZL Mielec will further ensure '
         'Poland is part of the F-16 global enterprise for many years to '
         'come.” Beyond the F-16, Poland is also procuring 32 F-35s, the first '
         'of which will be delivered in 2024. The complementary capabilities '
         'and interoperability between both fighter aircraft types serves to '
         'strengthen Poland’s airpower capabilities and enables partnerships '
         'across missions, training, equipment and tactics with other NATO '

 'text': 'SUNNYVALE, Calif. , Nov. 23, 2021 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and '
         'the U.S. Space Force conducted the system level Critical Design '
         'Review (CDR) for the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared '
         'Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (NGG) Block 0 space program. This marks '
         'another significant step toward the first NGG satellite launch in '
         '2025. NGG is the Space Force’s new, advanced space-based missile '
         'warning system that incorporates improved warning capabilities as '
         'well as enhanced resiliency and cyber hardening. Dubbed by the U.S. '
         'Department of Defense as a “Go Fast” acquisition program – meaning a '
         'quicker delivery timeline – NGG will provide early warning for the '
         'defensive “kill chain” that protects our nation and armed forces '
         'from missile threats. The new system responds to challenges from '
         'rival nations that increasingly seek to erode space advantages held '
         'by the United States. “Our adversaries are finding ways to make '
         'missile warning more difficult. They are also posing threats to '
         'space assets themselves,” said Joseph Rickers, Lockheed Martin vice '
         'president and program manager for NGG Block 0. “NGG was specifically '
         'designed as a ‘Go Fast’ program to maintain and grow our nation’s '
         'advanced technology edge ahead of the threat.” The NGG Block 0 '
         'program held the system level CDR on October 28, maintaining the '
         'program’s accelerated pace.\xa0The CDR specifically addressed the '
         'integration between the space and ground segments in addition to the '
         'integration of the Next Generation Interim Operations Ground System '
         'with the legacy Missile Warning system, enabling the enhanced '
         'missile warning capabilities following launch. A Race Against the '
         'Threat Under the NGG Block 0 program, Lockheed Martin in partnership '
         'with the U.S. Space Force is developing and building three '
         'satellites that provide improved missile warning capabilities and '
         'are even more resilient against emerging threats. Carrying new '
         'advanced infrared sensors that can detect dimmer and faster targets, '
         'the first satellite is racing to launch in 2025. The system level '
         'CDR is the latest milestone the program has met since the 2018 '
         'contract award. Earlier this year, under Lockheed Martin’s prime '
         'contractor leadership, NGG completed CDRs for two mission payloads '
         'being competitively developed by subcontractor teams Raytheon and a '
         'Northrop Grumman/Ball team. One of the two mission payloads will '
         'each fly on the first two NGG space vehicles. The team completed a '
         'separate space vehicle CDR, which aggregated numerous subsystem and '
         'payload reviews, and locked in the satellite’s technical baseline. '
         '“A space program of this size, which includes developing two '
         'entirely new missile warning payloads, has never moved this fast,” '
         'added Rickers. “The program is on schedule due to using proven '
         'technologies and risk mitigation tools like subsystem prototypes for '
         'early design verification and interface integration to ensure we '
         'remain on track.” Digitally Transforming for Speed Lockheed Martin’s '
         'NGG program is embracing digital transformation as a way to deliver '
         'next generation capabilities quicker and faster. The company is '
         'using digital engineering capabilities including digital twin, '
         'artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, along '
         'with augmented reality to speed production, integration and test and '
         'enabling the rapid transition to operations. For even more speed, '
         'greater resiliency and cyber-hardening, NGG is being built on '
         'Lockheed Martin’s LM 2100 Combat Bus . This modernized space vehicle '
         'provides enhanced spacecraft power, propulsion and electronics, as '
         'well as common components and procedures to streamline '
         'manufacturing. It features a flexible design that reduces the cost '
         'to incorporate future, modernized sensor suites or other mission '
         'augmentation capabilities. For more information, visit: '

         'enable NASA’s initiative to stimulate the commercial space economy '
         'and provide science and crew capabilities prior to the retirement of '
         'the International Space Station (ISS). “While today marks a major '
         'milestone for Nanoracks and our Starlab team, the impact goes far '
         'beyond this award,” said Dr. Amela Wilson, CEO at Nanoracks. “To '
         'receive this support from NASA validates over a decade of Nanoracks’ '
         'hard work forging commercial access to space, bringing over 1300 '
         'commercial payloads from 30 nations to the ISS. This opportunity '
         'opens far-reaching possibilities for critical research and '
         'commercial industrial activity in LEO.\xa0 We are honored to be '
         'selected as one of three awardees to work with NASA, and we cannot '
         'wait to bring our existing global commercial customer base to '
         'Starlab.” The initial $160 million award to Nanoracks is made via a '
         'funded Space Act Agreement through 2025. This initial NASA-provided '
         'funding will be supplemented with customer pre-buy opportunities and '

 'text': 'STRATFORD, Connecticut, Dec. 7, 2021 – The Federal Aviation '
         'Administration (FAA) has completed its certification of the S-70M '
         'Black Hawk helicopter — a new type designation — by issuing '
         'Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: LMT) a Restricted '
         'Category Special Airworthiness Certificate. FAA certification, and '
         'the establishment of a pilot type rating, are expected to broaden '
         'the market for the military-designed helicopter by allowing civil '
         'and commercial operators in the United States to purchase new Black '
         'Hawk aircraft direct from the factory. “With type certification, new '
         'production S-70M Black Hawk helicopters in the latest configuration '
         'are available to the U.S. commercial/civil market for the first '
         'time,” said Jason Lambert, vice president of Sikorsky Global '
         'Commercial & Military Systems. “Internationally, where the FAA '
         'restricted category is not widely accepted, we can now discuss with '
         'other civil aviation authorities the potential of validating the '
         'aircraft for challenging civil operations in their countries’ '
         'airspace.” “We thank the FAA for its rigorous evaluation of the '
         'first S-70M aircraft, and FlightSafety International for its '
         'partnership to upgrade an S-70i™ flight simulator and training '
         'curriculum to S-70M FAA standards,” he said. “We also congratulate '
         'and welcome our first S-70M customer, San Diego Gas & Electric, '
         'which requires the rugged design and lift capacity of the Black Hawk '
         'helicopter to perform the demanding aerial firefighting mission.” '
         'First customer delivery California public utility San Diego Gas & '
         'Electric (SDG&E) took delivery of the first S-70M Restricted '
         'Category aircraft on November 18 at the Sikorsky Training Academy in '
         'Stuart, Florida. SDG&E will modify the aircraft to the Firehawk ® '
         'configuration at United Rotorcraft, a division of Air Methods in '
         'Colorado. By 2023, the aircraft will be ready to drop water onto '
         'wildland fires with high accuracy from its 3,785-liter '
         '(1,000-gallon) external tank. FlightSafety role FlightSafety was '
         'instrumental to the certification effort. “As Sikorsky’s authorized '
         'S-70 Black Hawk training partner, FlightSafety sees how important '
         'the S-70M model will be to the global helicopter market,” said David '
         'Harper, center manager, FlightSafety Learning Center in West Palm '
         'Beach, Florida. “We invested heavily to develop an all-new S-70M '
         'pilot training curriculum with advanced courseware, and upgrade our '
         'flight simulator to a full motion Level-D capability. Work is '
         'underway with the FAA to gain Part 142 approval for our training '
         'course. FlightSafety is excited that pilots requiring S-70M initial '
         'type rating or an Airline Transport Pilot upgrade will soon be able '
         'to get those ratings at our facility in West Palm Beach.” Journey to '
         'FAA certification Sikorsky received a type certificate for the S-70M '
         'aircraft from the FAA in February 2019, and produced the '
         'first-of-type aircraft a year later. During 2020-21, Sikorsky proved '
         'the aircraft conformed to the type design, and assisted the FAA in '
         'establishing the new type rating. The FAA certified the S-70M '
         'aircraft under Part 21 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations in '
         'the Restricted Category, basing its certification on the U.S. Army '
         'UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter. Although capable of several special '
         'purpose operations in the Restricted Category, Sikorsky requested '
         'approval for three: Agricultural operations; External Cargo, which '
         'allows usage of the aircraft’s 4,082 kg (9,000 lbs.) external lift '
         'cargo hook; and Forest and Wildlife Conservation, which includes the '
         'dispensing of liquids on wildfires. PZL Mielec, a Lockheed Martin '
         'company, will build S-70M aircraft conforming to the FAA Restricted '
         'Category Special Airworthiness Certificate in Poland. Like the '
         'S-70i™ aircraft, the S-70M is a third-generation Black Hawk '
         'helicopter featuring a digital cockpit, GE 701D engines, and wide '

 'text': 'KENNEDY Space Center, Florida, Nov. 10, 2021 – Today, the '
         'next-generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite '
         '(GOES)-T successfully arrived at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, to '
         'begin launch preparations. It is the third of four satellites in the '
         'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s GOES-R '
         'weather satellite series built by Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] in '
         'Littleton, Colorado. GOES-T will help NOAA provide forecasters in '
         'the U.S. and western hemisphere with sharper, more defined images of '
         'severe storms, hurricanes, wildfires and other weather hazards. “The '
         'technology and instruments we’ve developed for the GOES-R series '
         'enable GOES-T to observe Earth and space weather faster and more '
         'accurately than ever,” said Lockheed Martin GOES-R chief engineer, '
         'Jagdeep Shergill. “Lockheed Martin has built more than 100 weather '
         'and environmental observation spacecraft throughout our history, and '
         'we couldn’t be more excited to add GOES-T to that lineup as we use '
         'continue to evolve the technology toward the future with each system '
         'we build.” Hitching a Ride with a Friend Given that GOES-T is the '
         'size of a small school bus, it needed a spacious ride to Florida. '
         'For this, the team looked no further than the Lockheed Martin-built '
         'C-5M Super Galaxy aircraft. To protect GOES-T’s sensitive, '
         'state-of-the-art instruments, the Lockheed Martin team enclosed the '
         'spacecraft in a shipping container that functioned as its own '
         'miniature cleanroom environment. That container was then transported '
         'from the company’s Littleton facility to Buckley Space Force Base in '
         'Aurora, Colorado, where it was carefully loaded onto the C-5 for '
         'transit to Florida. Forecasting Fit for the Future GOES-T, like the '
         'other satellites in the GOES-R series, will provide significant '
         'benefits to North America in the form of climate monitoring, '
         'ecosystems management, commerce and transportation. Measurement of '
         'weather data in these areas is increasingly important as severe '
         'weather patterns driven by climate change impact lives and '
         'livelihoods around the world. GOES-T will also help with: More about '
         'the Mission The GOES-R Series is a collaborative acquisition and '
         'development effort between NOAA and the National Aeronautics and '
         'Space Administration (NASA) to develop, launch and operate weather '
         'satellites. NOAA manages the GOES satellites and distributes their '
         'data to users worldwide, while NASA oversees the acquisition of the '
         'spacecraft and instruments, in addition to the management of the '
         'launch through NASA’s Launch Services Program. In addition to '
         'building all four satellites in the GOES-R series, Lockheed Martin '
         'also produced two of the primary instruments aboard: the '
         'Geostationary Lightning Mapper and Solar Ultraviolet Imager. With '
         'GOES-16 and 17 already on orbit, GOES-T is currently scheduled to '

 'text': 'Arlington , Texas, Nov. 2, 2021 – Students at The University of '
         'Texas at Arlington will receive valuable hands-on learning '
         'opportunities to advance their academic and career goals through a '
         'new work experience partnership between UTA and Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE: LMT). Launched in 2021, the UTA College Work Experience '
         'Program (CWEP) will make up to $5.2 million available for eligible '
         'students to gain real-world employment skills by holding paid '
         'positions at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control in Grand '
         'Prairie, Texas. The unique program is the second of its kind between '
         'Lockheed Martin and a university. “Lockheed Martin has long been one '
         'of UTA’s most valued corporate partners,” UTA Interim President Teik '
         'C. Lim said. “The College Work Experience Program will create more '
         'opportunities for our students to succeed academically and '
         'professionally while broadening Lockheed Martin’s access to these '
         'talented and diverse scholars.” CWEP will operate through UTA’s '
         'Lockheed Martin Career Development Center , with a first-year goal '
         'of 75 student participants and capacity to expand to 300 students by '
         'the third year, according to Career Development Center Director '
         'Lolin Martins-Crane. “One of the most important things we can do is '
         'create a pipeline of talented students for employment at global '
         'organizations,” said Martins-Crane. “Our ability to partner with '
         'Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control to help drive the '
         'Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington economy is very important. I’m excited '
         'about the potential to grow this model and make an even greater '
         'impact in North Texas.” Although CWEP jobs will primarily target '
         'engineering and business majors, students from all disciplines and '
         'academic classifications, including graduate students, may apply, '
         'provided they meet the criteria. Work experiences will encompass a '
         'minimum of two semesters but may span a student’s entire UTA tenure. '
         '“By giving UTA students real-world experience through the CWEP '
         'program, we’re helping develop the next generation of talent our '
         'industry needs right now,” said Monet Nathaniel, vice president of '
         'Human Resources at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. “We’re '
         'proud of this partnership and look forward to welcoming the best and '
         'brightest from UTA to join us as we solve complex challenges and '
         'help keep our nation safe.” The program will also fund a coordinator '
         'to manage the application process and screen top candidates. Hiring '
         'managers at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control will conduct '
         'interviews and make the final selections. Lockheed Martin has '
         'successfully partnered with the University of Central Florida on a '
         'similar program for the past 40 years. CWEP is one of numerous UTA '
         'initiatives designed to increase meaningful engagement between the '
         'University and the corporate community. It also aligns with UTA’s '
         'Maverick Advantage program, which prepares students for careers '
         'through experiential learning opportunities. Lockheed Martin is the '
         'No. 1 employer of UTA graduates, with more than 2,100 working at '
         'facilities worldwide, including large concentrations at Lockheed '
         'Martin Missiles and Fire Control and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in '
         'Fort Worth. The corporation’s $1.5 million naming gift in 2017 has '
         'enabled the Lockheed Martin Career Development Center to expand and '
         'improve its facilities and increase programming and participation. '
         'The center serves 25,000 students and holds over 600 events and '
         'experiences for students and alumni each year. Lockheed Martin’s '
         'longstanding partnership with UTA also includes philanthropic '
         'support for diversity programming and other initiatives in the '

         'Corporation [NYSE: LMT] today reported third quarter 2021 net sales '
         'of $16.0 billion , compared to $16.5 billion in the third quarter of '
         '2020. Net earnings from continuing operations in the third quarter '
         'of 2021 were $614 million , or $2 .21\xa0per share, compared to $1 '
         '.8\xa0billion, or $6 .25\xa0per share, in the third quarter of 2020. '
         'Cash from operations was $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021 '
         'and 2020.  "During the third quarter, the men and women of Lockheed '
         'Martin continued to deliver essential products and capabilities for '
         'domestic and allied national defense, and for pioneering civil space '
         'endeavors," said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO James '
         'Taiclet . "At the same time, we continued to advance the state of '
         'the art and innovation across key technologies, including Future '
         'Vertical Lift, Integrated Air and Missile Defense, hypersonic weapon '
         'systems, next generation satellites, and many others. "In addition, '
         'we have recently undertaken a reassessment of our five-year business '
         'plan given recent external and programmatic events. Our conclusions, '
         'which are reflected in our updated 2021 guidance and subsequent '
         'trend information, reflect continuing strong cash flow generation, '
         'but a slight reduction in revenue in 2022 and roughly flat to '
         'low-single-digit growth rates in both revenue and segment operating '
         'profit over the next few years, with increasing growth opportunities '
         'in the years that follow. "Consequently, we are adjusting our '
         'capital allocation strategy with two major objectives. First, to '
         'expand further our robust reinvestment in the company to serve our '
         "customers' evolving needs through capital projects and independent "
         'research and development for mid- to long-term enhanced growth '
         'performance. Simultaneously, we plan to reward shareholders with '
         'continued dividend growth and meaningful increases to the scale and '
         'rate of our share repurchase program. Over the short-, mid- and '
         'long-term, we will strive to maximize cash flow per share '
         'dynamically, based on revenue growth opportunities, inorganic '
         'investments, and share repurchases to take full advantage of our '
         'significant cash flow generation and strong balance sheet." Third '
         'quarter 2021 net earnings include a noncash pension settlement '
         'charge of $1.7 billion ( $1.3 billion , or $4.72 per share, '

         'through coalitions, it has no assurance that these provisions will '
         'be modified or repealed. The preliminary outlook for 2022 also '

         'tax rate of 21%, known impacts of COVID-19, and the continued '

         'results as a result of continued COVID-19 disruption or '
         'implementation of the vaccine executive order have been incorporated '

         'cannot predict how the pandemic will evolve or what impact it will '
         "continue to have. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on the company's "
         'financial results beyond the time of this news release remain '
         "uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company's "
         "underlying assumptions are correct. Additionally, the company's "
         'preliminary outlook for 2022 assumes no significant reduction in '
         'customer budgets, changes in funding priorities and that the U.S. '
         'Government will not operate under a continuing resolution for an '
         'extended period in which new contract and program starts are '
         'restricted. It also does not incorporate the pending acquisition of '
         'Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. Changes in circumstances may '
         'require the company to revise its assumptions, which could '
         'materially change its current estimate of 2022 net sales, business '
         'segment operating margin, and cash flows. The company currently '
         'expects a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.2 '
         'billion in 2022, which includes total expected U.S. Government cost '
         'accounting standards (CAS) pension cost of approximately $1.8 '
         'billion and total expected financial accounting standards (FAS) '
         'pension income of approximately $400 million . The estimated FAS '
         'pension income amount assumes a 2.75% discount rate (the same rate '
         'used for the remeasurement of the defined benefit pension plans '
         'impacted by the pension risk transfer transaction in the third '
         'quarter of 2021), a 10.0% return on plan assets in 2021, and a 6.5% '
         'expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years, '
         'among other assumptions. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points '
         'to the assumed discount rate, with all other assumptions held '
         'constant, would result in an incremental increase or decrease of '
         'approximately $10 million to the estimated net 2022 FAS/CAS pension '
         'benefit. A change of plus or minus 100 basis points to the return on '
         'plan assets in 2021 only, with all other assumptions held constant, '
         'would result in an incremental increase or decrease of approximately '
         '$15 million to the estimated net 2022 FAS/CAS pension benefit. The '
         'company does not expect to make any contributions to its qualified '
         'defined benefit pension plans in 2022. The company will complete the '
         'annual remeasurement of its postretirement benefit plans and update '
         'its estimated 2022 FAS/CAS pension adjustment on Dec. 31, 2021 . The '
         'final assumptions, including the discount rate and actual investment '
         'return for 2021, may differ materially from those discussed above. '
         "Cash Deployment Activities The company's cash deployment activities "
         'in the third quarter of 2021, included the following: As previously '
         'announced on Sept. 23, 2021 , the company increased its quarterly '
         'dividend by $0.20 per share, to $2.80 per share, beginning with the '
         'dividend payment in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the '
         'company repurchased $2.0 billion in common stock during the first '
         'nine months of 2021 and increased its share repurchase authority by '
         '$5.0 billion with $6.0 billion in total remaining authorization for '
         'future repurchases of common stock under the program as of Sept. 26, '
         '2021 . Segment Results The company operates in four business '
         'segments organized based on the nature of products and services '
         'offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and '

         'allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under '
         'the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or '
         'federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not '

         'compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance '
         'actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from '
         'divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. The '
         'company recovers CAS pension cost through the pricing of its '
         'products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, '
         "recognizes CAS pension cost in each of its business segments' net "
         "sales and cost of sales. The company's consolidated financial "
         'statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit '
         'plan income calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under '
         'U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The operating portion '
         'of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference '
         'between the service cost component of FAS pension (expense) income '
         'and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension (expense)\xa0'
         'income component is included in other non-service FAS pension '
         '(expense) income in our consolidated statements of earnings. The net '
         'FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or decreases CAS pension cost '
         'to equal total FAS pension income (both service and non-service). '
         'Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in '
         'terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases '
         'in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production '
         'activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual '
         'contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically '
         'based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. '
         "In addition, comparability of the company's segment sales, operating "
         'profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably '
         "by changes in profit booking rates on the company's contracts for "
         'which it recognizes revenue over time using the '
         'percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress '
         'towards completion. Increases in profit booking rates, typically '
         'referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the '
         'estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that '
         'reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, '
         'conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an '
         'increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance '
         'obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or '
         'decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current '
         'period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. '
         'Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably '
         'or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. '
         'Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual '
         'matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, '
         'insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items '
         'may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; '
         'restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions '
         'which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for '
         'disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain '
         "assets. The company's consolidated net adjustments not related to "

         'approximately 31% of total segment operating profit in the third '

         'manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the '

         "included in the company's financial results beginning in the third "
         'quarter of 2021. Because of the renationalization, no sales or '
         "operating profit for the AWE program are included in the company's "
         'financial results for the third quarter of 2021. However, during the '

         'Contracts and Pension Remeasurement As previously announced, on Aug. '
         '3, 2021 the company purchased group annuity contracts to transfer '
         '$4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and '
         'related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 '
         'U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The group annuity contracts were '
         "purchased using assets from Lockheed Martin's master retirement "
         'trust and no additional funding contribution was required by the '
         'company. This transaction has no impact on the amount, timing, or '
         'form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected '
         'retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, the '
         'company recognized a noncash settlement charge of $1.7 billion ( '
         '$1.3 billion , or $4.72 per share, after-tax) for the affected plans '
         'in the quarter ended Sept. 26, 2021 , which represents the '
         'accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in '
         'the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within '
         "stockholders' equity. As a result of this transaction, the company "
         'was required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets '
         'for the affected defined benefit pension plans in the quarter ended '
         'Sept. 26, 2021 . The purchase of the group annuity contracts and the '
         "pension remeasurement did not have an impact on the company's CAS "
         "pension cost and did not significantly impact the company's total "

         'flew an extended range mission over the Pacific Ocean. “The '
         'Precision Strike Missile continues to validate range and performance '

         'and software factory to streamline efforts has helped accelerate '
         'PrSM’s development program with speed, agility and efficiency. “We '

         'successfully launched from Florida at 5:34 a.m. ET this morning.     '
         '"Seeing Lucy start her journey reinforces the strength of the 500 '
         'team members from NASA, Lockheed Martin, the Southwest Research '
         'Institute and many other teams who worked together to bring this '
         'mission to life," said Rich Lipe , Lockheed Martin Lucy program '
         'manager. "It\'s a tale centered on flexibility, collaboration and '
         'ingenuity, which is fitting for the voyage that lies ahead for this '
         'advanced spacecraft." The spacecraft was designed, built and tested '
         "in Lockheed Martin's Littleton facility, using transformative "
         "technology. The company's mission operations team is now in "
         'communications with the spacecraft and will operate it through the '
         'end of its mission. Lucy will be the farthest solar-powered mission '
         'from the Sun and will visit a record-breaking number of asteroids – '
         'all in the name of studying them for clues about our own origins. '
         "Engineering for an Epic Journey Lucy's 4-billion-mile odyssey "
         'through the solar system will last 12 years and fly by eight '
         'objects: one Main Belt asteroid and seven Trojan asteroids that lead '
         'and trail Jupiter in its orbit. Scientists are keen for an up-close '
         'look at these ancient rocks, which are believed to be pristinely '
         'preserved leftovers from the formation of our outer solar system 4 '
         'billion years ago. With such a long, unforgiving journey through '
         "space, Lucy's engineers designed the spacecraft to be ready for "
         'anything. Lucy draws on heritage design elements from previous '
         'Lockheed Martin-built missions like OSIRIS-REx and MAVEN . Key '
         'features of the Lucy spacecraft include:  The team also made use of '
         'the latest collaborative tools and digital engineering techniques on '
         'Lucy, including automated testing, digital test review capability '
         'and remote collaboration. These tactics helped the team continue '
         'production without missing a shift throughout the pandemic. Seeking '
         "Science for the Next Generation The long duration of Lucy's endeavor "
         'means that a student in 4 th grade now could find themselves working '
         'on this mission when they graduate college. The spacecraft also '
         'draws its name from another scientific discovery that students may '
         'recognize from their history books. Much like the '
         '3.2-million-year-old Lucy skeleton fundamentally changed our '
         'understanding of human evolution, this mission aims to change the '
         'way we understand how the planets – including Earth – formed. Donald '
         'Johanson , who discovered the famous fossil in 1974, is thrilled to '
         'see the spirit of scientific exploration live on through the Lucy '
         'mission. "The mission teaches us something about the '
         'interconnectedness of people over time and space," he remarked. "A '
         'poignant moment in the history of humanity that brings the past and '
         'the present together – and launches us into the future." More About '

 'text': 'FORT WORTH, Texas, Sept. 29, 2021 – The Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 '
         'Lightning II and Virtual Aegis Weapon System (VAWS) demonstrated the '
         'ability to share real-time sensor data from Fort Worth, Texas, to '
         'Honolulu, Hawaii, and on to the Australian Defence Force during a '
         'recent military exercise between the United States and Australia. In '
         'partnership with U.S. Indo Pacific Command, Lockheed Martin’s '
         'participation in Talisman Sabre 2021 (TS21) continued the '
         'military/industry team’s experimentation efforts to improve joint '
         'interoperability between U.S. services and allies. The exchange of '
         'real-time F-35 data with non-F-35 platforms outside of the United '
         'States via the F-35’s multi-function advanced data link directly '
         'supports goals presented in the Pacific Deterrence Initiative. This '
         'initiative includes using large-scale exercises to pursue innovative '
         'experimentation in support of building joint all-domain information '
         'sharing capabilities. “With this demonstration, the F-35 has proven '
         'that its sensor fusion capabilities make it the most advanced node '
         'in the 21st century warfare network-centric architecture,” said '
         'Bridget Lauderdale, Lockheed Martin vice president and general '
         'manager of the F-35 program. “We are proud to deliver on the '
         'expectations of our customers in the Indo-Pacific Command theater '
         'and in Australia and look forward to working with them to build on '
         'the capabilities the F-35 has proven thus far.” In the 21st century '
         'battlespace, dominance will be determined by the ability to securely '
         'connect high-tech platforms into one cohesive network that spans '
         'every domain – air, land, sea, space and cyber. This recent '
         'demonstration strengthens the U.S. military’s interoperability with '
         'its allies against the heightened strategic threat environment. Only '
         'the F-35 has the ability to reach into austere environments to '
         'provide critical real-time information back to allied defense '
         'forces. Starting with Talisman Sabre in 2019, Lockheed Martin has '
         'collaborated with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command on experimentation to '
         'enhance kill webs, which are a multitude of sensors that collect, '
         'prioritize, process, and share data, then fuse it into a '
         'continuously updated display of information for joint forces. The '
         'demonstrations conducted during TS21 are further proof of Lockheed '
         'Martin’s ability to quickly connect advanced technology, provide '
         'commanders more options to meet their objectives, and ensure '
         'warfighters have the information needed to quickly make critical '
         'decisions in the battlespace. To date, the F-35 operates from 21 '
         'bases worldwide, with nine nations operating F-35s on their home '
         'soil. There are more than 670 F-35s in service today, with more than '
         '1,440 pilots and 10,850 maintainers trained on the aircraft. The '
         'Aegis Weapon System’s versatility is reflected in afloat, ashore, '
         'expeditionary and virtual operations, with seven nations utilizing '
         'Aegis’ proven multi-mission capability. For additional information, '

 'text': 'ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 21, 2021 – In partnership with the Air Force, '
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) recently deployed Rapid Dragon munition '
         'pallets from C-17 and EC‑130 aircraft and released surrogate '
         'JASSM-ERs in system-level flights conducted over White Sands Missile '
         'Range, New Mexico. Rapid Dragon is a fast-paced U.S. Air Force '
         'Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation (SDPE) program '
         'that has moved from concept to surrogate missile deployment in just '
         '10 months. “These Rapid Dragon deployments represent the first '
         'end-to-end demonstration of a palletized strike mission, from '
         'rolling missile pallets onto an aircraft to in-flight missile '
         'release,” said Scott Callaway, Lockheed Martin Advanced Strike '
         'Programs director. “They are a big step toward showing the '
         'feasibility of the palletized munitions concept and the ability of '
         'mobility aircraft to augment the strike capacity of tactical '
         'fighters and strategic bombers.” The Rapid Dragon team conducted an '
         'airdrop from a C-17A Globemaster III and another from an EC-130SJ '
         'Commando Solo. In both flights, aircrews deployed a pallet at an '
         'operationally relevant altitude. Once stabilized by parachutes, the '
         'pallets released surrogate missiles in quick succession, each '
         'aerodynamically identical to a JASSM-ER. A ground crew transmitted '
         'new targeting information to the Rapid Dragon system during both '
         'flights via beyond line-of-sight communications. The ability to '
         'retarget missiles while the aircraft is airborne provides combatant '
         'commanders the flexibility to respond to changes in a dynamic '
         'operational\xa0environment. SDPE and Lockheed Martin are conducting '

 'text': 'SYRACUSE, NY, Oct. 11, 2021 - The U.S. Army Sentinel A4 Program '
         'Office provided an accelerated contract award to Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE:LMT) to begin production for five additional radar systems '
         'developed specifically to detect and identify cruise missiles, '
         'unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft, and '
         'rocket, artillery, and mortar threats. Army soldiers will use these '
         'radars to evaluate the operations of the new Sentinel A4s, which are '
         'projected to be delivered by the end of 2022. “The Lockheed Martin '
         'team truly understands the importance that this system holds for our '
         'warfighters,” stated Troy Allen, program manager for the U.S. Army '
         'Sentinel A4 program office. “Once equipped with the Sentinel A4, our '
         'soldiers will operate in a more secure warfighting environment, '
         'improving capabilities against multiple evolving threats.” “This '
         'latest contract was awarded two years earlier in the development '
         'process than in previous programs, thanks to the team’s continued '
         'success in meeting all milestones ahead of schedule,” said Mark '
         'Mekker, director of Army Radars for Lockheed Martin. “It’s not only '
         'representative of the hard work of our employees, but also the U.S. '
         'Army’s confidence in the experience and performance of Lockheed '
         'Martin.” First Sentinel A4 Radar Completed in August, An '
         'Unprecedented Five Months Ahead of Schedule Even though the initial '
         'Sentinel A4 contract for 18 radars was awarded only two years ago, '
         'the Sentinel A4 team already completed production of the first A4 '
         'system this summer. Lockheed Martin executed a full radar '
         'development program, including the traditional design process '
         'events, most of which was completed during strict COVID-19 '
         'conditions, in that short timeframe. The first five systems of the '
         'original contract are expected to be delivered to the U.S. Army in '
         'March 2022. How Sentinel A4 Is Staying Ahead of Schedule The '
         'Sentinel A4 program has an agile development process and has stayed '
         'ahead of schedule for several reasons. The Mission: Improved '
         'Detection of Advanced Threats The $281 million contract to develop '
         'the Sentinel A4 system was awarded to Lockheed Martin in September '
         '2019. The new air and missile defense radar will provide improved '
         'capability in contested environments against cruise missiles, '
         'unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft, and '
         'rocket, artillery, and mortar threats.\xa0 This includes enhanced '
         'surveillance, detection, and classification capabilities to protect '

         'Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The work will generate 80 new jobs in the '
         'city and the company plans to lease a new building to accommodate '
         'it. Wayne Davis, director at Lockheed Martin’s Johnstown site, says '
         'Lockheed Martin continues to see demand for new F-16s around the '
         'world, requiring development of additional parts manufacturing sites '
         'to ensure it can keep up with demand. “Johnstown’s selection for '
         'this new work reflects the highly skilled workforce in the area, a '
         'record of quality production and the space available to expand,” '
         'Davis said. “We are proud to grow our presence in Johnstown and to '
         'contribute to the acceleration of jobs.” F-16 parts to be produced '
         'in Johnstown include the aft engine access covers, engine access '
         'doors, F-1 fuel tank, and inlet. Upon completion in Johnstown, the '
         'parts will be shipped to Greenville, South Carolina, for final '
         'assembly and integration into the F-16s on the production line. This '
         'is in addition to F-16 component and sub-assembly work already '
         'performed at the site today. Early work in Johnstown will kick off '
         'this year, with the bulk of hiring and other significant efforts '
         'beginning in 2022. In addition to the F-16 work, the Johnstown '
         'facility also provides parts and services for the F-35 and F-22 '
         'fighter jets, and the C-130 military transport aircraft. In addition '
         'to the nearly 400 jobs already in place at the site today, Lockheed '
         'Martin maintains a strong presence in the Johnstown community, '
         'giving more than $42,000 to local organizations and efforts last '
         'year.    About the F-16 The F-16 is a strategic and valuable choice '
         'for many customers around the world seeking advanced, 4th generation '

         'aircraft will undergo 12-year servicing (depot maintenance) at a '
         'Lockheed Martin-approved Heavy Maintenance Center (HMC) beginning in '
         '2022. The Government of India announced its purchase of six C-130J '
         'Super Hercules airlifters via a Foreign Military Sale with the U.S. '
         'Air Force in 2008. All aircraft were delivered on or ahead of '
         'schedule between 2010 and 2011. India received additional C-130Js in '
         '2017 and in 2019. The IAF’s C-130J Super Hercules have a highly '
         'integrated and sophisticated configuration primarily designed to '
         "support India's special operations requirement. The aircraft also "
         'are equipped with air-to-air receiver refueling capability for '
         'extended range operations. India’s C-130Js are also used to support '
         'a variety of critical missions, including humanitarian aid, airlift, '
         'natural disaster support, and search and rescue operations. '
         'Recently, the IAF has been extensively using its fleet of 12 Super '
         'Hercules for humanitarian efforts in the wake of the COVID-19 '
         'pandemic as well as for transportation of relief materials, '
         'equipment and personnel in the areas affected by cyclones Yaas and '
         'Tauktae. India’s connection to the C-130J goes beyond its fleet of '
         'Super Hercules with the Tata Lockheed Martin Aerostructures Limited '
         '(TLMAL) joint venture that is the single, global source of C-130J '
         'empennage assemblies included on all new Super Hercules aircraft. '

         'Company [NYSE: LMT] has approved the use of Sustainable Aviation '
         'Fuel (SAF), often referred to as biofuel, for the S-92 helicopter as '
         'an alternative to petroleum-based fuels and the aircraft completed '
         'its first flight. This approval occurs as companies across the '
         'aviation industry are taking steps to meet environmental challenges, '
         'including transitioning to sustainable aviation fuels derived from '
         'renewable non-fossil fuel sources and utilized by aircraft certified '
         'for Jet A/A-1 fuels. CHC Helikopter Service of Norway, was the first '
         'to fly the S-92 helicopter using Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene '
         '(HEFA-SPK) which is one of seven types of approved SAFs available '
         'today.\xa0SAFs are capable of reducing lifecycle carbon emissions by '
         'up to 80% when compared to petroleum-based jet fuels. HEFA-SPK is '
         'produced from waste and residual feedstock such as used cooking oil. '
         '“As a Corporation, we are committed to sustainability and I am proud '
         'that our S-92 helicopter is playing a role in a more sustainable '
         'future,” said Jason Lambert, Sikorsky’s vice president of Global '
         'Commercial and Military Systems. “The aircraft is known for its '
         'unmatched advantages and the use of biofuel is one more attribute on '
         'that list.” GE Aviation, which manufactures the CT7-8A engines that '
         'power the S-92 helicopter, supports Sikorsky’s ambitions to reduce '
         'carbon emissions through the use of SAF. GE is heavily involved in '
         'the qualifying and testing of approved SAF blends. “The S-92 '
         'helicopter’s first flight using SAF further demonstrates how SAF can '
         'be used today with our CT7 engines to lower CO2 emissions,” said '
         'Harry Nahatis, vice president and general manager of GE Turboshaft '
         'Engine programs. “All GE engines are capable of using approved SAF '
         'blends without any modifications, and we firmly believe flights like '
         'this demonstrate how SAF can contribute to more sustainable flight '
         'across the aviation industry.” Norwegian offshore helicopters will '
         'be the\xa0first to fly commercial flights on biofuel on the Sikorsky '
         'S-92 helicopter. The use of biofuel across the S-92 global fleet is '
         'an additional benefit to the offshore oil and gas mission. For '

         'availability while reducing pilot and crew workload. “This '
         'Connecticut-built CH-53K aircraft is a testament to the Sikorsky '
         'legacy of building safe, reliable rotorcraft \xa0for decades. But '
         'the way we design, test and build helicopters has transformed,” said '
         'Paul Lemmo, President, Sikorsky. “Our employees are using digital '
         'tools and other advanced technologies such as manufacturing '
         'simulation and 3D laser inspection technology. This factory '
         'transformation is a model for all future helicopter programs at '

         'part of a 200 aircraft Program of Record for the Marine Corps with a '
         'total of 33 aircraft currently on contract and an additional nine on '
         'contract for long lead parts. “The CH-53K\xa0 helicopter provides '
         'advanced capabilities allowing Marines to get anywhere in the world '
         'where the mission requires heavy-lift logistics support,” said '
         'Deputy Commandant for Aviation, Lt. Gen. Mark R. Wise during a '
         'ceremony at Sikorsky.\xa0 “This helicopter is a much safer aircraft '
         'because it can maneuver in low visibility environments. It will '
         'forward deploy Marines quickly and effectively.” Ramping Up '
         'Production in Sikorsky’s Digital Factory The factory floor at '
         'Sikorsky is active with six CH-53K aircraft in build, and there are '
         '36 more in various stages of production including the nine that we '
         'are procuring long lead parts for. Sikorsky has made significant '
         'investments in workforce training, tooling, and machinery to '
         'increase the number of aircraft built and delivered year over year. '
         'This is the first CH-53K helicopter to roll off the Stratford, '
         'Connecticut production line, with the next one set to be delivered '
         'in early 2022. Since October 2020, Sikorsky has delivered three '
         'operational CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopters to the U.S. '
         'Marine Corps in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Flying in the Fleet '
         'Environment The CH-53K program entered initial Operational Test & '
         'Evaluation (IOT&E) in July. Four aircraft are now in the hands of '
         'VMX-1 operational and test evaluation squadron.\xa0 Marine pilots '
         'and maintainers are operating the CH-53K in a fleet environment as '
         'part of the rigorous test program. Marines are learning to fly and '
         'maintain the CH-53K using a suite of training devices developed by '
         'Sikorsky. Pilots receive hands-on training by experiencing a highly '
         'immersive virtual environment in the Containerized Flight Training '
         'Device (CTFD). The CFTD replicates the functionality, flight '
         'characteristics, mission profiles, and unmatched capabilities of the '
         'CH-53K helicopter. The device can replicate the various '
         'environmental conditions that the aircraft is likely to fly in as '
         'well as a multitude of mission profiles in the operation of a true '
         'heavy-lift helicopter. Maintenance personnel also prepare with a '
         'virtual aircraft environment through the Helicopter Emulation '
         'Maintenance Trainer. Marines train with an immersive experience to '
         'practice avionics and airframe maintenance in the schoolhouse in '
         'order to be fully prepared to perform maintenance on their fleet '
         'aircraft. #OnlyTheKCan The CH-53K is the only sea-based, long range, '
         'heavy-lift helicopter in production and will immediately provide '
         'three times the lift capability of its predecessor. The CH-53K will '

 'text': 'White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, Aug. 9, 2021 – In flight '
         'tests at White Sands Missile Range on Aug. 9, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: '
         'LMT) demonstrated new upgrades to its PAC-3 Missile Segment '
         'Enhancement (MSE) interceptor and continued reliability of its PAC-3 '
         'Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) interceptor. “Flight tests like '
         'these demonstrate how we continue to evolve PAC-3 to ensure we '
         'remain ready for the 21 st century battlefield while also showcasing '
         'our record of reliability in the field,” said Brenda Davidson, vice '
         'president, PAC-3 Programs. “The warfighter needs to know that the '
         'PAC-3 missiles protecting them are going to work, every time.” '
         'During the tests, a PAC-3 MSE successfully intercepted a tactical '
         'ballistic missile target, validating missile and launcher software '
         'and hardware component upgrades. The upgrades, which enable future '
         'performance of the PAC-3 MSE interceptor to keep pace against '
         'expanding threats of today and tomorrow, will be incorporated into '
         'production over the next year. Separately, two PAC-3 CRI missiles '
         'each successfully intercepted a tactical ballistic missile target in '
         'support of the U.S. Army’s Field Surveillance Program (FSP) that '
         'confirms the reliability and readiness of fielded PAC-3 missiles. '
         'The tests marked the 17 th and 18 th successful PAC-3 CRI FSP '
         'intercepts, reconfirming the missile’s ability to detect, track and '
         'intercept threats while meeting fielded reliability requirements. '
         'The first PAC-3 MSE FSP flight test is scheduled to take place later '
         'this year. Both U.S. Army-led flight tests demonstrated the unique '
         'capability of the PAC-3 family of missiles, the only combat proven '
         'Hit-to-Kill interceptors that defend against incoming threats, '
         'including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. '
         'PAC-3 missiles defend against incoming threats through direct '
         'body-to-body contact, delivering exponentially more kinetic energy '
         'on the target than can be achieved with blast-fragmentation kill '
         'mechanisms. Fourteen nations have chosen PAC-3 CRI and PAC-3 MSE to '
         'provide missile defense capabilities. For additional information, '

 'text': 'SYRACUSE, N.Y., Sept. 13, 2021 – As the world’s most capable and '
         'flexible ground based multi-function long-range radar, Lockheed '
         'Martin’s TPY-4 has received its official U.S. Government '
         'nomenclature – AN/TPY-4(V)1 – officially marking the radar’s '
         'maturity and its ability to deliver fully-digital technology, and '
         'therefore setting a new standard for the future of radars. “Our team '
         'has worked diligently to deliver this advanced radar supporting '
         'domestic and international air surveillance requirements,” said '
         'Chandra Marshall, vice president and general manager at Lockheed '
         'Martin. “This designation represents our commitment to furthering '
         'our radar capabilities to specifically overmatch emerging, complex, '
         'and advanced threats.” Lockheed Martin’s specialized team has spent '
         'more than 10 years and more than $100 million in research & '
         'development funds for the TPY-4 radar, including the construction, '
         'operation, and testing of prototype radar systems. TPY-4 offers '
         'multi-mission capabilities, such as early warning, situational '
         'awareness, tactical ballistic missile surveillance and air defense. '
         'It also integrates the latest mature commercial technologies to '
         'create a revolutionary radar architecture. Recent Testing '
         'Achievements The first TPY-4 is well ahead of any competition and '
         'already in production to be unveiled later this year . The radar’s '
         'production sub-assemblies are passing environmental and performance '
         'tests, attributed to the foundation built and validated under '
         'Lockheed Martin’s investment and the commonality with the U.S. '
         'Army’s Sentinel A4 radar . The radar’s test results continue to '
         'surpass model predictions, as validated by open air testing, '
         'furthering the qualification of this advanced radar. The TPY-4 '
         'Radar: A Fully Digital Solution for Today’s and Tomorrow’s Threats '
         'TPY-4 is an internationally available, transportable, multi-mission '
         'radar that can operate in contested RF environments and provide the '
         'warfighter an ability to detect and track threats better than any '
         'previous radar available today. It accomplishes this with a fully '
         'digital, software-defined sensor architecture, allowing users to '
         'maintain ongoing surveillance throughout the mission. That’s because '
         'the TPY-4 radar users are not locked by the system’s hardware. Users '
         'have the ability to transmit and receive digitally, allowing for '
         'more enhanced target identification and classification. Earlier '
         'radars may have some level of digitization, but Lockheed Martin’s '
         'software-defined TPY-4 radar is digital at every element and across '
         'the entire architecture. Users don’t have to account for downtime '
         'for time-consuming actions, like hardware upgrades or manual data '
         'transfers. “Our digital transmitter and receiver architecture '
         'provides flexibility to adjust performance for evolving missions, '
         'threats, and environments,” said Rick Herodes, Lockheed Martin’s '
         'Radar and Sensor System’s Ground Based Air Surveillance program '
         'director. “TPY-4 provides unprecedented flexibility through software '
         'updates without invasive or time-consuming architectural redesigns, '
         'therefore making it the most effective risk management solution for '
         'national defense.” Lockheed Martin Radar Family History TPY-4 was '
         'developed to include all the experience that Lockheed Martin’s radar '
         'product family offers. The technology investments include Gallium '
         'Nitride (GaN), which Lockheed Martin has been delivering worldwide '
         'since 201 7, providing greater efficiency and improved reliability '
         'as compared to legacy systems. Lockheed Martin’s long range and '
         'medium range surveillance radars have set the industry standard for '
         'ground-based air surveillance for decades. With more than 60 years '
         'of experience developing and delivering ground-based radar solutions '

         'not only provide incredible capability to the Hellenic Navy but help '
         'to re-build a proud and historic shipbuilding industry here in '
         'Greece”. "The U.S. government is 100% committed to the U.S. Navy '
         'proposal for the Hellenic Navy’s Frigate Modernization Program, '
         'which represents a generational opportunity to expand and deepen our '
         'outstanding U.S.-Greece naval partnership. Our proposal is backed by '
         'a government-to-government agreement, offering a real and highly '
         'capable ship, not just an idea on paper, with an unmatched plan for '
         'building in Greece, said U.S. Ambassador to Greece Geoffrey R. '
         'Pyatt. “It will boost the revival of the Greek shipbuilding industry '
         'and create over a thousand direct shipbuilding jobs, and over a '
         'thousand indirect ship-related jobs across the Greek maritime '
         'sector, spurring further the revival of Greece’s long maritime '
         'traditions. I know that Lockheed Martin is eager to participate in '
         'the renaissance of Greek shipbuilding, and they are also very '
         'committed to partnering with George Prokopiou, a great friend of the '
         'United States, who has just acquired the Skaramangas shipyards." '
         'Lockheed Martin will work with our Greek industry partners including '
         'the Shipyards as appropriate completely focused on successful '
         'program execution in coordination with U.S. Navy and Hellenic Navy. '
         'Lockheed Martin will look to introduce more Greek teammates in the '
         'weeks to come. The team will leverage and build upon the deep '
         'knowledge and expertise of the Greek defense industry expanding '
         'capabilities in ship design, logistics, training, and sustainment. '
         'Lockheed Martin’s partnership with Greece spans more than 75 years '
         'including numerous successful programs, such as the F-16, C-130 and '
         'P-3. In 2020, Greece added the MH-60R to their fleet. In parallel '
         'with this acquisition, the Hellenic Navy, U.S. Navy and Lockheed '
         'Martin are working together with local industry for the sustainment '
         'and modernization of the existing S-70B fleet. Lockheed Martin '
         'highly values its enduring relationship with Greece, the Hellenic '
         'Armed Forces and Greek industry and looks forward to building upon '
         'that successful heritage.  About the Hellenic Future Frigate The '
         'Hellenic Future Frigate (HF2) is multi-mission frigate, taking '
         'proven systems operational in the US Navy from both the Arleigh '
         'Burke DDGs and the FREEDOM class LCS, enhanced to address the '
         'Hellenic Navy’s requirements. The Hellenic Navy will benefit from '

 'text': 'ENGLEWOOD, Colorado – August 26, 2021 – United Rotorcraft, a '
         'division of Air Methods Corporation, has awarded Sikorsky, a '
         'Lockheed Martin company, a contract for five S-70™ Black Hawk® '
         'helicopters. The bulk order will enable United Rotorcraft, as the '
         'only company authorized by Sikorsky to modify Black Hawk aircraft to '
         'the FIREHAWK® configuration, to quickly deliver these new production '
         'aircraft for aerial firefighting in support of public agencies '
         'battling increasingly destructive wildland fires. “The FIREHAWK '
         'helicopter is fast becoming one of the most powerful and effective '
         'aerial firefighting assets in California, attacking and '
         'extinguishing wildfires before they spread out of control,” said '
         'Larry Alexandre, United Rotorcraft president. “Acquiring five S-70 '
         'Black Hawk aircraft from Sikorsky with deliveries over the next 7 to '
         '18 months confirms United Rotorcraft’s commitment to the FIREHAWK '
         'helicopter and its mission, and ensures their availability to '
         'support future demand from U.S. Western States or firefighting '
         'agencies around the world.” Sikorsky will produce the five S-70 '
         'Black Hawk aircraft at Lockheed Martin’s PZL Mielec manufacturing '
         'line in Poland. Deliveries to United Rotorcraft’s 55,000+ square '
         'foot completions facility in Colorado are expected between early '
         '2022 and mid-2023. The first aircraft received will be configured as '
         'a FIREHAWK helicopter for the State of Colorado, which announced its '
         'contract with United Rotorcraft on Aug. 16. “Sikorsky and United '
         'Rotorcraft have worked closely for 25 years to develop, test and '
         'upgrade two S-70 variants of the FIREHAWK helicopter for the Los '
         'Angeles County Fire Department, CAL FIRE and the San Diego '
         'Fire-Rescue Department,” said Jason Lambert, vice president of '
         'Sikorsky Global Commercial and Military Systems. “We applaud United '
         'Rotorcraft’s bold leadership to bring the toughest, safest, most '
         'reliable fire suppression and rescue helicopter in existence today '
         'into the hands of first responders sooner than ever.” To modify a '
         'Black Hawk helicopter to the Firehawk configuration, United '
         'Rotorcraft installs and integrates a 1,000-gallon (3,785-liter) '
         'external water tank system to the aircraft’s belly. Fingertip '
         'controls allow pilots to drop the precise amount of water with high '
         'accuracy and refill the tank via a retractable snorkel in 60 seconds '
         'or less while hovering 10 feet over a water source. United '
         'Rotorcraft works hand in hand with public agencies to further '
         'customize the aircraft, as needed, from communications and '
         'navigation systems, to cabin interiors, transforming the FIREHAWK '
         'into a true multi-mission aircraft, with the ability to transport up '
         'to 12 firefighters, provide medical care on board, or perform search '
         'and rescue operations. Thirteen S-70 FIREHAWK helicopters currently '
         'fighting fires across California are operated by CALFIRE, Los '
         'Angeles County Fire Department, and San Diego Fire Rescue '
         'Department. Five more contracted aircraft are on the way. About '

 'text': "DENVER , Aug. 2, 2021 / PRNewswire / --\xa0NASA's Lucy spacecraft "
         'has officially arrived at Kennedy Space Center, Florida , to begin '
         'preparations ahead of its launch this fall.     "This spacecraft is '
         "so much more than a piece of hardware, it's a work of art, and I'm "
         'incredibly proud of how the team came together to build this through '
         'a global pandemic," said Rich Lipe , Lockheed Martin Lucy program '
         'manager. "To be here now, starting to prepare for launch, is a '
         'terrific feeling." Designed and built by Lockheed Martin for NASA, '
         "Lucy will give humankind its first ever close-up look at Jupiter's "
         'elusive Trojan asteroids. These celestial objects are important '
         'because scientists believe they could hold clues about how our solar '
         'system and the planets formed. Shipping a Precious Package In the '
         'pre-dawn hours Friday, Lucy took the first steps of its 12-year, '
         'four-billion-mile odyssey to the "fossils" of the solar system by '
         'boarding a cargo plane in Colorado . And moving a nearly one-ton '
         'spacecraft 18 months in the making is no small feat. After '
         'converting a shipping container into its own mini cleanroom '
         'environment, a team of Lockheed Martin engineers carefully placed '
         'Lucy inside and loaded the spacecraft onto a special transport truck '
         "at the company's Littleton, Colorado , facility. Flanked by its own "
         'police escort, the truck made its way to Buckley Space Force Base in '
         'Aurora, Colorado , where a team of about 40 people from Lockheed '
         'Martin, NASA and Southwest Research Institute met Lucy and tucked '
         'the spacecraft safely inside its C-17 transport aircraft. After '
         'touching down on the Space Shuttle Landing Strip at Kennedy Space '
         'Center , Lucy was moved to Astrotech Space Operations, where it will '
         'begin preparations for a 23-day launch window that opens Oct. 16. '
         "What's Ahead in the Journey? Following its pre-launch testing, "
         'launch vehicle integration and liftoff on an Atlas V 401 rocket, the '
         'path that lies ahead will see Lucy visit a record-breaking number of '
         'asteroids – eight, to be precise. As part of a highly complex '
         'orbital trajectory, Lucy will fly by one Main Belt asteroid and '
         'seven Trojan asteroids – ancient objects trapped within gravity '
         'wells created by the combined pull of Jupiter and the sun, near '
         'so-called Lagrange Points . One group leads and one group trails '
         'Jupiter in its orbit. The spacecraft will use precise instruments to '
         'study the geology, surface composition and physical properties of '
         'these primitive Trojan asteroids. Scientific theory hypothesizes '
         'these objects were scattered during the creation of our outer solar '
         "system roughly 4 billion years ago and later captured in Jupiter's "
         'orbit – remaining there, undisturbed, for billions of years. These '
         'genuine "fossils" of the solar system could hold clues about what '
         'conditions were like when the planets formed, leading to an even '
         "greater understanding of our own origins. Lucy's first asteroid "
         'flyby occurs in 2025, and the last planned flyby will be in 2033. '
         'More About the Mission For more than 50 years, Lockheed Martin has '
         'helped NASA explore every planet in our solar system and continues '
         'to develop new technologies for future space missions like Lucy. '

         'allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under '
         'the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or '
         'federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not '
         "considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating "
         'performance such as a portion of management and administration '
         'costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, stock-based '
         'compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance '
         'actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from '
         'divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. The '
         'company recovers CAS pension cost through the pricing of its '
         'products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, '
         "recognizes CAS pension cost in each of its business segments' net "
         "sales and cost of sales. The company's consolidated financial "
         'statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit '
         'plan income calculated in accordance with FAS requirements under '
         'U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The operating portion '
         'of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference '
         'between the service cost component of FAS pension income and total '
         'CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension income component is '
         'included in other non-operating income. The net FAS/CAS pension '
         'adjustment increases or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total '
         'FAS pension income (both service and non-service). Changes in net '
         'sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of '
         'volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales '
         'or operating profit resulting from varying production activity '
         'levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume '
         'changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the '
         'current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, '
         "comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and "
         'operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes '
         "in profit booking rates on the company's contracts for which it "
         'recognizes revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion '
         'cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. '
         'Increases in profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk '
         'retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total '
         'costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved '
         'conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a '
         'particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the '
         'estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a '
         'reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in '
         'profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and '
         'reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment '
         'operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or '
         'unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. '
         'Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual '
         'matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, '
         'insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items '
         'may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; '
         'restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions '
         'which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for '
         'disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain '
         "assets. The company's consolidated net adjustments not related to "
         'volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, represented '

 'text': 'LITTLETON , Colo., Aug. 23, 2021 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has '
         'invented a new type of satellite dish technology with a wide range '
         'of use on satellites and ground terminals, including space-based 5G. '
         'The Wide Angle ESA Fed Reflector (WAEFR) antenna is a hybrid of a '
         'phased array Electronically Steerable Antenna (ESA) and a parabolic '
         'dish, and increases coverage area by 190% compared to traditional '
         'phased array antennas at a much lower cost. This antenna is part of '
         'a larger research and development investment in 5G.MIL™ technologies '
         'that will optimize and securely connect warfighting platforms to '
         'enable joint all-domain command and control (JADC2) . Lockheed '
         'Martin is uniquely positioned, leveraging commercial best practices, '
         'strong partnerships, a broad supply chain and leadership expertise, '
         'to bring 5G connectivity and capabilities to the defense community '
         'rapidly and affordably. “We adopted a commercial mindset to quickly '
         'mature this technology and discovered there were multiple use cases '
         'and applications that could benefit from this new hybrid antenna,” '
         'said Chris Herring, vice president of advanced program development '
         'at Lockheed Martin Space. “5G.MIL technologies like this will bring '
         'greater connectivity, faster and more reliable networks, and new '
         'data capabilities to support our customers as they navigate the '
         'complexity of 21st century battlefields.” The team rapidly '
         'prototyped, tested and validated this system in a matter of months '
         'compared to what previously took years. WAEFR also features: This '
         'type of antenna will also benefit the broader communications and ISR '
         'communities by providing a more reliable scanning solution compared '
         'to gimbaled designs. “The primary benefit of the WAEFR approach is '
         'accomplishing more mission with fewer resources,” said Thomas Hand, '
         'Ph.D., associate technical fellow at Lockheed Martin Space. “While '
         'state of the art ESA solutions can address more demanding link '
         'performance, capacity, and data rates using multiple agile analog '
         'beams, they do so at a premium.” For additional information, visit '

         'missile attacks. The GMD system includes silo-based interceptors, '
         'connections to sensors on land and sea, distributed fire control and '
         'launch support systems. Currently, the GMD system engages a threat '
         'using the best single source data from multiple radars. The next '
         'upgrade to C2BMC, called Spiral 8.2-7, will provide GMD with a '
         'single, real-time, composite picture of threat system tracks by '
         'correlating and fusing data from a broader set of sensors, including '
         'satellites, ground- and ship-based radars. Once the spiral upgrade '
         'is complete, the GMD system will see the same battlespace picture '

         'will also enable C2BMC to report hypersonic threat activity onto the '
         'Link 16 military tactical data link network and display to the '
         'operators. “C2BMC is a 21st century battle management system, with a '

 'text': ' CANBERRA, Australia , 5 August 2021, Lockheed Martin Australia, '
         'welcomed today’s announcement by the Minister for Defence, The Hon '
         'Peter Dutton MP, and the Minister for Defence Industry, The Hon '
         'Melissa Price MP, on the Government’s official down selection of '
         'Lockheed Martin Australia, as one of the two primes selected, to '
         'participate in the Royal Australian Air Force’s AIR6500 Phase 1 '
         'Project (AIR6500-1): Competitive Evaluation Process Stage 2 (CEPS2). '
         'AIR6500-1 will provide the Australian Defence Force (ADF) with a '
         'Joint Air Battle Management System that will form the architecture '
         'at the core of the ADF’s future Integrated Air and Missile Defence '
         '(IAMD) capability. This will provide greater situational awareness '
         'and defence against increasingly advanced air and missile threats, '
         'as well as give the ADF increased levels of interoperability with '
         'coalition partners. Joe North, Chief Executive Lockheed Martin '
         'Australia and New Zealand said, “Today’s announcement marks the next '
         'step in AIR6500-1 to work in partnership with the Australian Defence '
         'Force and industry partners to support the Royal Australian Air '
         'Force’s vision to transform the Air Force into a next-gen-enabled '
         'force through delivering a sovereign highly advanced Joint Air '
         'Battle Management System to protect Australia’s security.” “Since '
         '2016, we have been highly committed to supporting the AIR6500-1 '
         'project. Our Lockheed Martin Australia AIR6500-1 team has steadily '
         'grown over this time to over 80 Australians in Adelaide, Canberra '
         'and Williamtown.” “Critical to that effort has been our focus on '
         'proactively engaging and establishing important partnerships with '
         'Australian industry to identify and invest in ‘best of breed’ local '
         'capabilities to deliver a truly sovereign capability solution for '
         'Australia,” said Mr. North. Lockheed Martin Australia will continue '
         'partnering with industry, academia and government to develop, '
         'integrate, build, and sustain future technologies that can be '
         'integrated into an open architecture framework to support AIR6500-1. '
         'This approach will ensure innovative small to medium Australian '
         'high-tech businesses remain at the core of shaping Australia’s '
         'future defence capabilities. “We look forward to collaborating with '
         'Australian industry and the Royal Australian Air Force to progress '
         'the AIR6500-1 solution as part of the CEPS2. We would like to '
         'congratulate Northrop Grumman for also being down selected for the '
         'CEPS2,” said Mr. North. Steve Froelich, Lockheed Martin Australia '
         'AIR6500 Program Executive reflected that today’s AIR6500-1 '
         'announcement will set new standards for Joint All Domain Operations. '
         'He said “AIR6500-1 will make it possible to combine Australia’s '

 'text': 'TITUSVILLE, Fla. , July 15, 2021 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed '
         'Martin\xa0[NYSE: LMT] opened its Spacecraft Test, Assembly and '
         'Resource (STAR) Center today. The STAR Center features business and '
         'digital transformation innovations that will expand manufacturing, '
         "assembly and testing capacity for NASA's Orion spacecraft program "
         'and ultimately, future space exploration.     Lockheed Martin '
         'currently assembles the Orion spacecraft for the Artemis I and II '
         'Moon missions at the nearby Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout '
         "(O&C) building at NASA's Kennedy Space Center . The addition of the "
         'STAR Center provides much-needed space for the new production phase '
         'of Orion, allowing future Orion spacecraft – starting with the '
         'Artemis III mission – to be built faster. "The STAR Center is a '
         'spacecraft factory of the future and is the centerpiece of our '
         'commitment to build sustainable and affordable capabilities for NASA '
         'to send astronauts to explore the Moon and eventually Mars," said '
         'Lisa Callahan , Commercial Civil Space vice president and general '
         'manager at Lockheed Martin Space. "We are using advanced '
         'manufacturing capabilities and digital-first technologies to speed '
         'production and improve quality to get Orion from factory to space '
         'faster than ever before." Lockheed Martin acquired the building that '
         'formerly housed the Astronaut Training Experience attraction and '
         'spent 18 months and nearly $20 million renovating and modernizing '
         'the 55,000 square-foot space into a digitally-transformed factory of '
         'the future. Digital Transformation Means Efficiencies The STAR '
         "Center showcases Lockheed Martin's ability to implement the latest "
         "digital transformation technologies, along with the company's "
         'existing production expertise, to scale Orion production and deliver '
         'spacecraft faster than ever before. Those include integrating the '
         "STAR Center into Lockheed Martin's Intelligent Factory Framework "
         '(IFF), an edge computing platform that secures, scales and '
         'standardizes device connectivity through various IT platforms. This '
         'digital-first approach streamlines production and maximizes agility '
         'by connecting devices virtually. Lockheed Martin has already '
         'deployed IFF to seven locations and is scaling across the entire '
         'company. In addition, more than 30 machines at the STAR center will '
         "be connected to this IFF, as well as machines at NASA's O&C, giving "
         'all production team members at both facilities real-time access to '
         'valuable data. The center also employs remote access, monitoring and '
         'alerting technologies for equipment, plus smart tools such as '
         'virtual reality and augmented reality. Room to Grow Under Lockheed '
         "Martin's production contract with NASA, the agency has committed to "
         'order Orion vehicles for six missions, with the potential to add '
         'another six through 2030. Elements of the spacecraft that take large '
         'amounts of floor space and that are built and tested outside the '
         'normal spacecraft assembly flow will be moved to the STAR Center. '
         'This gives production teams more room at the O&C facility to '
         'assemble and test more Orion spacecraft simultaneously and quicker. '

 'text': 'DENVER, June 22, 2021 – NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory awarded '
         'Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] a contract to design and build the '
         'aeroshell for the Mars Sample Retrieval Lander. The capsule will '
         'protect the spacecraft through its landing sequence on Mars when it '
         'hits the atmosphere with extreme speed and force that generate '
         'thousands of degrees of heat. "We are excited to partner with JPL '
         'again to design, fabricate and test an aeroshell for a Mars '
         'mission,” said David Buecher, Lockheed Martin program manager for '
         'the Mars Sample Retrieval Lander aeroshell. “By protecting this next '
         'spacecraft during its descent to Mars, we’re delighted to have a '
         'role in the safe delivery of another element of the Mars Sample '
         'Return program.” Bringing Home a Piece of Mars The Mars Sample '
         'Retrieval lander is the next big step in NASA’s visionary Mars '
         'Sample Return campaign. The lander will retrieve samples of Martian '
         'soil taken by the Perseverance Rover, which landed on the Red Planet '
         'in February 2021. An ascent vehicle brought by the lander will then '
         'launch those samples into Martian orbit to rendezvous with a '
         'European Space Agency orbiter for their trip to Earth in the early '
         '2030s. With the specifics of the sample retrieval lander still being '
         'finalized, the aeroshell team will draw from its abundant deep space '
         'experience to meet any unique mission needs. Lockheed Martin has '
         'designed and built aeroshells for 10 previous NASA Mars missions – '
         'including Perseverance – as well as sample return spacecraft like '
         'Stardust and Genesis. Building a World Class Aeroshell The aeroshell '
         'is comprised of a cone-shaped backshell and a disc-like heat shield '
         'that encapsulate the spacecraft. The protective structure keeps the '
         'spacecraft safe during the months-long, frigid cruise in deep space, '
         'slows its speed upon arrival and protects it from intense heat '
         'during the complex landing sequence and touchdown on Mars. The heat '
         'shield bears the brunt of the extreme temperatures created when the '
         'spacecraft hits Mars’ atmosphere at high speeds. Made of a durable '
         'thermal protective material called Phenolic Impregnated Carbon '
         'Ablator (PICA) – designed at NASA’s Ames Research Center – it '
         'absorbs the heat and keeps the spacecraft cool in temperatures that '
         'can reach 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The backshell is hand-packed '
         'with another special thermal protection material called SLA-561v, '
         'seen above. Invented by Lockheed Martin for the first-ever Mars '
         'landers in the 1970s, this super lightweight ablator made of '
         'silicone and cork mitigates heat while also minimizing weight. '
         'Lockheed Martin has been involved in all 22 NASA missions to Mars '
         'and has partnered with the agency to explore every planet in our '
         'solar system. In the future, the team looks forward to continuing '
         'that legacy with this next Mars aeroshell, supporting the first ever '
         'sample return mission from a planet. About Lockheed Martin '

         "return to Earth's sister planet after more than three decades. "
         '"We\'re very grateful for this opportunity to work with NASA and the '

         'Radio Science, InSAR, Topography & Spectroscopy – will have its '
         "science and operations managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory "
         'in Southern California . Why Does Venus Matter? Though scientists '
         'believe it was once similar to our home planet, Venus evolved to be '
         "much different – and far less habitable – than Earth. As Earth's own "
         'climate and geology evolve, interest in returning to Venus has '
         'surged because the planet currently suffers from a runaway '
         'greenhouse gas effect. Over millennia, water that may have once '
         "existed on Venus' surface evaporated and carbon dioxide built up in "
         "the atmosphere – leading to a present-day surface temperature that's "
         'hot enough to melt lead. Previous missions to Venus have even '
         'provided tantalizing clues that the planet may have once harbored a '
         'liquid ocean. DAVINCI+ and VERITAS will build on those findings, '
         'helping scientists better understand the existence of past life on '
         'Venus and how its atmosphere and geology may have influenced its '
         'ultimate outcome. Science from these missions could provide clues '
         "about Earth's own future and will also help inform future missions "
         "to the planet. Studying Venus' Geology with VERITAS As an orbiter "
         'that draws on heritage from the Lockheed Martin-built MAVEN '
         'spacecraft at Mars, VERITAS will give scientists the most detailed '
         "maps ever produced of Venus' obscured landscape. When VERITAS "
         'arrives at Venus, the orbiter will use a special technique called '
         'aerobraking to carefully insert itself into an optimal science '
         "position in the planet's orbit. As the spacecraft circles Venus in "
         "four cycles near the planet's poles, two extremely sensitive imagers "
         'will capture things like volcanic activity, tectonics and outgassing '
         "of any life-related compounds like water or carbon. Measuring Venus' "
         'Atmosphere with DAVINCI+ Part orbiter and part probe, the DAVINCI+ '
         "spacecraft will provide a look into Venus' atmosphere in "
         'unprecedented detail. When it arrives at Venus, the DAVINCI+ '
         "spacecraft will jettison a probe to the planet's surface. As it "
         'descends, three instruments will take the first-ever live '
         "measurements from inside Venus's atmosphere – assessing gases, "
         'material composition, temperature and pressure. A camera on board '
         "will also snap the most detailed images ever taken of Venus' hidden "

         'sending humans back to the Moon where they will explore and conduct '
         'scientific experiments using a variety of rovers. NASA sought '
         'industry approaches to develop a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) that '
         'will enable astronauts to explore the lunar surface farther than '
         'ever before. The LTV is the first of many types of surface mobility '
         "vehicles needed for NASA's Artemis program. To support NASA's "
         'mission, the two industry leaders will\xa0develop a unique vehicle '
         'with innovative capabilities, drawing on their unparalleled '
         'engineering, performance, technology and reliability legacies. The '
         'result may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in '
         'unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans '
         'have never gone before. Lockheed Martin will lead the team by '
         'leveraging its more than 50-year-history of working with NASA on '
         "deep-space human and robotic spacecraft, such as NASA's Orion "
         'exploration-class spaceship for Artemis and numerous Mars and '
         'planetary spacecraft. "This alliance brings together powerhouse '
         'innovation from both companies to make a transformative class of '
         'vehicles," said Rick Ambrose , executive vice president, Lockheed '
         'Martin Space. "Surface mobility is critical to enable and sustain '
         'long-term exploration of the lunar surface. These next-generation '
         'rovers will dramatically extend the range of astronauts as they '
         'perform high-priority science investigation on the Moon that will '
         "ultimately impact humanity's understanding of our place in the solar "
         'system." GM is a leader in battery-electric technologies and '
         'propulsion systems that are central to its multi-brand, '
         'multi-segment electric vehicle strategy, positioning the company for '
         'an all-electric future. Additionally, GM\xa0will use\xa0autonomous '
         'technology to facilitate safer and more efficient operations on the '
         'Moon. "General Motors made history by applying advanced technologies '
         'and engineering to support the Lunar Rover Vehicle that the Apollo '
         '15 astronauts drove on the Moon," said Alan Wexler , senior vice '
         'president of Innovation and Growth at General Motors. "Working '
         'together with Lockheed Martin and their deep-space exploration '
         'expertise, we plan to support American astronauts on the Moon once '
         'again." GM has a proven history of supporting NASA and working '
         'within the space industry. The company manufactured, tested and '
         'integrated the inertial guidance and navigation systems for the '
         'entire Apollo Moon program, including Apollo 11 and the first human '
         'landing in 1969. GM also helped develop the electric Apollo Lunar '
         'Roving Vehicle (LRV), including the chassis and wheels for the LRV '
         "that was used on Apollo's 15-17 missions. Unlike the Apollo rovers "
         'that only traveled 4.7 miles (7.6 kilometers) from the landing site, '
         'the next-generation lunar vehicles are being designed to traverse '
         'significantly farther distances to support the first excursions of '
         "the Moon's south pole, where it is cold and dark with more rugged "
         'terrain. Autonomous, self-driving systems will allow the rovers to '
         'prepare for human landings, provide commercial payload services, and '
         'enhance the range and utility of scientific payloads and '
         'experiments. Lockheed Martin brings unparalleled experience and '
         'capabilities in deep-space exploration. It has built spacecraft and '
         'systems that have gone to every planet, been on every NASA mission '

 'text': 'OMAHA, Neb., May 11, 2021 – In partnership with the U.S. Air Force, '
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), has assisted the Air Force Life Cycle '
         'Management Center ( AFLCMC) in establishing the Rogue Blue Software '
         'Factory. This software development factory produces mission planning '
         'and command and control applications for the U.S. Strategic Command. '
         'The Rogue Blue Software Factory supports the Global Strike and '
         'Product Support (GSPS) contract, which delivers nuclear command, '
         'control, and communications planning capabilities for the U.S. '
         'Strategic Command’s mission planning and analysis system. Working '
         'closely with the U.S. Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base, '
         'the Lockheed Martin GSPS team leveraged agile development, security '
         'and operations (DevSecOps) methodologies to establish 12 software '
         'pipelines across three different labs. The team also created a '
         'cloud-based agile environment that has expedited the delivery of '
         'capabilities from six months to two weeks. “We used a novel '
         'microservice-patterned component architecture to break new ground on '
         'the use of containers at USSTRATCOM,” said Colleen Saint, Lockheed '
         'Martin GSPS program manager. “This expanded the capability of the '
         'system to ensure it would provide needed legacy capability while '
         'complying with the newest technical and cybersecurity standards.” '
         'The new environment, which includes rapid development and automated '
         'testing, was used to field the Strike Planning Aid (SPA) 2.0 system, '
         'the replacement for the USSTRATCOM conventional SPA weaponeering '
         'system. The SPA 2.0 system provides an optimized conventional '
         'weaponeering system for USSTRATCOM and has been assessed as 85 '
         'percent more efficient for the weaponeering of kinetic options. '
         '“Lockheed Martin has aligned processes to the Agile / DevSecOps '
         'vision and is a key teammate on the Agile path,” said AFLCMC program '
         'manager Lisa Owens. “By establishing the new DevSecOps pipelines for '
         'GSPS application, Lockheed Martin supported the completion of 120 '
         'sustainment spring deliveries to field the Strike Planning Aid 2.0 '
         'system.” Lockheed Martin has more than 20 years of on-site '

         'Center to integrate critical battle management capabilities from the '

         'Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite (KRADOS). As the original '

         'a complete suite of next generation tools to plan, execute, and '
         'assess joint theater air operations. In partnership with the Air '
         'Force, Lockheed Martin is migrating these TBMCS capabilities to '
         'Kessel Run’s cloud platform via a cloud-based software delivery '
         'environment dubbed Wolfpack. Wolfpack is the connective tissue, '

         'KRADOS can seamlessly exchange data to operational TBMCS interfaces '
         'managed by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. '
         'Through the Wolfpack application gateway, KRADOS will have the '

 'text': 'Palmdale, Calif., May 3, 2021 – Lockheed Martin Skunk Works ® , the '
         'Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. Air Force successfully linked a '
         'U-2, five F-35s and an F-22 in air and provided real-time 5th '
         'Generation data to operators on the ground, introducing greater '
         'mission flexibility across domains and an enhanced total operational '
         'picture for the joint warfighter. Named Project Hydra, the latest '
         'flight test leveraged an Open Systems Gateway (OSG) payload aboard '
         'the U-2 to connect an F-22 to five F-35s via native Intra-Flight '
         'Data Link (IFDL) and Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL), '
         'successfully sharing data between all airborne aircraft and with '
         'nodes on the ground. The target tracks were also transmitted by and '
         'through the U-2 into the fighter avionics and pilot displays. '
         '“Project Hydra marks the first time that bi-directional '
         'communications were established between 5th Generation aircraft '
         'in-flight while also sharing operational and sensor data down to '
         'ground operators for real-time capability,” said Jeff Babione, vice '
         'president and general manager, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works ® . “This '
         'next-level connectivity reduces the data-to-decision timeline from '
         "minutes to seconds, which is critical in fighting today's "
         'adversaries and advanced threats.” The Project Hydra effort also '
         'marked the first time F-35 sensor data was delivered to an '
         'operational ground system over a Tactical Targeting Network Terminal '
         '(TTNT) link using an airborne gateway. This data was then sent to '
         'the US Army Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) Airborne Sensor '
         'Adaptation Kit (A-Kit), also developed by Lockheed Martin. The A-Kit '
         'then transmitted data to the IBCS Tactical System Integration '
         'Laboratory (TSIL) at Fort Bliss, Texas. IBCS used the F-35 sensor '
         'data to conduct a simulated Army fires exercise. The core of the '
         'Hydra payload leverages the Open Mission Systems (OMS) compliant '
         'Enterprise Mission Computer 2 (EMC2), facilitating F-22, F-35, TTNT '
         'and Link-16 connections.\xa0 By leveraging both line-of-sight (LOS) '
         'and beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) datalink capabilities of the U-2, '
         'data can now be shared directly to tactical users and globally to '
         'command and control (C2) nodes like the Common Mission Control '
         'Center (CMCC). During this demonstration, both the CMCC and Shadow '
         'Operations Center at Nellis Air Force Base were able to view the '
         'sensor and platform data to enable situational awareness for '
         'operational command and control of highly capable air assets. '
         'Bringing the power of 5th Generation data and exposing new C2 '
         'opportunities across multiple domains continues to demonstrate '
         'Lockheed Martin’s readiness to provide unmatched battlespace '
         'awareness and rapidly field capability today. This demonstration is '
         'another key step forward in Lockheed Martin’s support for the Air '
         'Force’s Advanced Battle Management System and the Army’s Project '
         'Convergence, supporting the goal of providing commanders critical '

         'This integration gives existing and future Super Hornet fleets the '
         'ability to add Sniper ATP’s precision targeting and surveillance '
         'capabilities, which are critical to pilot survivability. '
         '"Integrating Sniper ATP onto Weapon Station 5, commonly known as the '

         'the mechanics of the system, flight testing with a non-operational '
         'Sniper ATP was conducted at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in '
         'Maryland in March. Subsequently, flight-testing with an operational '
         'Sniper ATP was conducted at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in '
         'California in March. Both first flight tests were successful. “The '
         'Sniper ATP provides an additional tool in the already robust Kuwait '

 'text': 'HUNTSVILLE, Ala. , April 15, 2021 / PRNewswire / --\xa0Flying low, '
         'fast and expertly executing crisp, tight, quick maneuvers that only '
         "Sikorsky's X2 Technology™ family of helicopters brings, the Sikorsky "
         'S-97 RAIDER ®\xa0helicopter flew two demonstrations before Army '
         'officials and Soldiers at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama '
         'this week. The events offered a glimpse at Sikorsky, a Lockheed '
         "Martin company's bid for the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft "
         "(FARA) program, part of the U.S. Army's Future Vertical Lift (FVL) "
         'effort to revolutionize its aircraft fleet. Sikorsky is a Lockheed '
         'Martin Company (NYSE: LMT).     View the video. The S-97 RAIDER , '
         'solely funded by Sikorsky is the only representative FARA aircraft '
         "flying today and provides risk reduction for Sikorsky's FARA "
         'concept, RAIDER X® ,\xa0a fast, agile, survivable compound coaxial '
         'helicopter that will allow future aviators to address evolving peer '
         'and near-peer threats in the most difficult environments. "Since the '
         'first Black Hawk took to the skies in the 1970s, to when our teams '
         'broke helicopter speed records with X2 Technology in 2010, we have '
         'been working with our Army partners to develop and deliver low-risk, '
         'transformational, affordable and sustainable aircraft to support the '
         'warfighters\' missions," said Sikorsky President Paul Lemmo , who '
         'was at Redstone this week. "This is the first of what we believe '
         'will be many times our X2 Future Vertical Lift aircraft will fly at '
         'Redstone." RAIDER X will fully integrate the strengths of Lockheed '
         'Martin such as digital thread, advanced manufacturing, sustainment, '
         'training, and weapon and mission system development, manufacture and '
         'integration.\xa0At Sikorsky, the digital thread is built into '
         'current programs and is being utilized today in our digital advanced '
         'manufacturing facility. This proven, holistic life-cycle approach '
         'runs seamlessly throughout the design, development, production, '
         "supply chain and sustainment process. Today, all of Sikorsky's "
         'programs are born in a digital environment. The power of this '
         'digital thread drives affordability, producibility and reliability '
         'across the aircraft lifecycle. In addition to the FARA competition, '
         'Sikorsky and partner Boeing are offering the DEFIANT X™ for the '
         "Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition. With "
         'RAIDER X and DEFIANT X, the Army could have common, scalable '
         'aircraft with the mission advantage the Army is looking for.\xa0Both '
         "FARA and FLRAA are among the Army's top modernization priorities "
         'meant to address near-peer threats in the multi-domain operations '
         '(MDO) of 2030 and beyond. "Through this week\'s RAIDER flight and '
         'our ongoing test program with DEFIANT, we are demonstrating the '
         'future of Army Aviation," said Kevin Mangum , Lockheed Martin vice '
         'president, Army programs. "With RAIDER X, we will fill a critical '
         'Army capability gap, providing the speed, reach, lethality and '
         'convergence to fight and win on the MDO battlefield, today and into '
         "the future. DEFIANT X will be the world's best assault aircraft – "
         'like our great Black Hawk – for decades to come. Our X2-designed '
         'aircraft provide commonality – in parts, systems, maintenance and '
         'training. And, DEFIANT X has the same operational footprint as the '
         "Black Hawk, reducing the Army's total cost of ownership by "
         'eliminating any modifications to existing facilities." Flight '
         'Demonstrations Highlight Maneuverability and Speed Where it Matters '
         "On April 13 and 15 at Redstone, Sikorsky's Christiaan Corry and Bill "
         'Fell piloted the S-97 RAIDER flight routines that highlighted both '
         'low-level helicopter maneuverability and the high-speed capability '
         "that only Sikorsky's X2 Technology family of helicopters offers. "
         'Corry previously flew with the first Army experimental test pilot in '
         'S-97 RAIDER , with additional events to come. "Flying RAIDER '
         'continues to amaze me," said Corry, a former U.S. Marine with more '
         'than 4,500 flight hours in 25 types of aircraft including the '
         'CH-53E, CH-53K and others. "The combination of the coaxial rotors '
         'and the propulsor are really the enablers for this transformational '
         'technology. As we demonstrated today, in low-speed flight we are as '
         'capable as a conventional helicopter, but when we engage the prop, '
         "we are able to operate in a whole new way – it's much more like "
         'flying an airplane." "RAIDER is a tremendous risk reduction vehicle '
         'for RAIDER X and DEFIANT X and enables us to make data-driven design '
         'decisions for both aircraft," said Fell, a retired Master Army '
         'Aviator and former Army experimental test pilot. "Every time we fly, '
         'we are learning something that goes right into RAIDER X and DEFIANT '
         'X." Sikorsky has been flying and testing X2 Technology for more than '
         'a decade, accumulating nearly 500 hours on its X2 Technology test '
         'beds and aircraft including the X2 Technology Demonstrator, RAIDER '
         'and DEFIANT. Sustaining the Future Fleet Using Tools Proven Today '
         'Also while at Redstone, Sikorsky discussed its approach to mission '
         'and weapons systems integration, manufacturing and sustainment. For '
         'example, its FVL aircraft will have much more actionable maintenance '
         'data , providing commanders with information to accurately assess '
         'the health state of the weapon systems as well as the ability to '
         'self-diagnose maintenance and predict aircraft availability. That '
         'increases the operational readiness and availability and reduces '
         "life cycle costs associated with that\xa0platform. With Sikorsky's "
         'Fleet Decision Tool, commanders can aggregate data from individual '
         'aircraft based on operational requirements, aircraft health '
         "assessment and maintenance flow to ensure they're optimizing "
         'readiness and aircraft availability across the entire\xa0fleet. '
         '"This means that I, as a commander, could look at my aircraft '
         'battalion and understand the health of each one of the aircraft and '
         'prioritize the right aircraft for the next mission," Mangum said. '
         '"This positions us to meet the Army\'s Maintenance-Free Operating '
         'Periods in which RAIDER X and DEFIANT X helicopters could operate '
         'without the need for service for an extended period of time." '

         'operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs '
         'not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. '
         'Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting '
         'standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other '
         "items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment "

         'significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains '
         'or losses from divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate '
         'activities. The corporation recovers CAS pension cost through the '
         'pricing of its products and services on U.S. Government contracts '
         'and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension cost in each of its business '
         "segments' net sales and cost of sales. The corporation's "
         'consolidated financial statements must present pension and other '
         'postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with '
         'U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as FAS '
         'expense). The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension '
         'adjustment represents the difference between the service cost '
         'component of FAS pension income and total CAS pension cost. The '
         'non-service FAS pension income component is included in other '
         'non-operating expense. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases '
         'or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension income '
         '(both service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating '
         'profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume '
         'refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit '
         'resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or '
         'service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment '
         'operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking '
         'rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of the '
         "corporation's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin "
         'may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit '
         "booking rates on the corporation's contracts for which it recognizes "
         'revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost '
         'method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in profit '
         'booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually '
         'relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the '
         'performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a '
         'particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract '
         'may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total '
         'costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the '
         'profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates '
         'are recognized in the current period and reflect the '
         'inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit '
         'and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other '
         'items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may '
         'include the positive resolution of contractual matters, insurance '
         'recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may '
         'include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring '
         'charges, except for significant severance actions which are excluded '
         'from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset '
         'impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. The '
         "corporation's consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, "

 'text': 'DENVER, May 10, 2021 – Scientists are now one step closer to '
         'learning more about how our solar system formed – and, potentially, '
         'the origins of life. Today, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which was '
         'designed, built and flown by Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] for NASA, '
         'departed asteroid Bennu and is headed back to Earth with a pristine '
         'asteroid sample. After a two-year, 1.4-billion-mile return cruise '
         'that includes two revolutions around the sun, OSIRIS-REx will catch '
         'up with Earth in its orbit in 2023 and jettison its sample return '
         'capsule. This protective capsule contains what is estimated to be '
         'well over the required 60 grams of regolith needed for scientific '
         'study, or roughly the size of a candy bar. “It’s both exciting and '
         'bittersweet,” said Sandy Freund, mission operations program manager '
         'of the Lockheed Martin Mission Support Area, where OSIRIS-REx is '
         'flown. “I can’t wait to see what we learn from the sample when it '
         'returns to Earth. Yet, at the same time, we’ve now said goodbye to '
         'this asteroid that we’ve gotten to know so well over the past couple '
         'of years.” The Science Behind the Mission Bennu is of keen interest '
         'for scientists because they believe it to be a well-preserved '
         'remnant from the beginnings of our solar system more than 4.5 '
         'billion years ago. It could contain clues about whether asteroids '
         'helped deliver ingredients for life to Earth and could also provide '
         'a glimpse into specific natural resources asteroids possess. Once '
         'Bennu’s sample lands in the Utah Test and Training Range on Sept. '
         '24, 2023, it will be curated at NASA’s Johnson Space Flight Center '
         'in Houston and shared with teams around the globe. With upcoming '
         'scientists and engineers in mind, NASA will save 75 percent of the '
         'sample for future generations to study. The Long Journey Home '
         'Today’s departure maneuver was the mission’s longest engine burn '
         'since arrival at Bennu in 2018. OSIRIS-REx’s main engines fired for '
         'seven minutes, changing its velocity by 0.16 miles per second – '
         'about the cruising speed of a commercial airliner – and sending it '
         'on a trajectory to meet up with Earth in two and a half years. '
         'OSIRIS-REx is the first NASA mission to collect material from an '
         'asteroid. It also represents the largest sample collected by a NASA '
         "mission since Apollo. This is NASA's third robotic sample return "

         'Strike Missile (PrSM) successfully completed its fourth consecutive '
         'flight test with the U.S. Army today in a 400-kilometer '
         'demonstration at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The PrSM was '
         'fired from a HIMARS® launcher and flew with expected precision to '
         'the target area where it once again demonstrated a highly accurate '
         'and effective warhead event. Test objectives included confirming '
         'flight trajectory, range and accuracy from launch to impact, as well '
         'as warhead lethality, HIMARS integration and overall missile '
         'performance. “PrSM accomplished all of the Army’s test objectives '
         'again today in its longest flight yet,” said Gaylia Campbell, vice '
         'president of Precision Fires at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire '
         'Control. “The missile’s impressive performance to date reflects the '
         'dedication of the joint-industry PrSM team to advance this '
         'capability with speed, efficiency and precision.” The 400-kilometer '
         'flight is the first of three demonstrations that will take place '
         'this year as part of the Enhanced Technology Maturation and Risk '
         'Reduction (ETMRR) phase of the development program. This series of '

 'text': 'FORT WORTH, Texas , April 7, 2021 / PRNewswire / --  Danish and '
         'American officials celebrated the rollout of the first F-35A '
         'Lightning II for the Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF) today at Lockheed '
         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) in Fort Worth, Texas . This major F-35 program '
         'milestone strengthens national defense and global partnerships '
         'between the United States , Denmark and other F-35 partner and '
         'buying nations.     "The security situation around the world is '
         'increasingly complex," said Trine Bramsen , Danish Minister of '
         'Defense. "Being able to defend yourself and your allies is crucial. '
         'For peace. For stability. For freedom and democracy. With the new '
         'F-35 fighter jets we will increase our ability to protect Denmark . '
         'Our region. And wherever necessary as we have done before - side by '
         'side with the U.S. and other allies. The F-35s will be at the '
         'absolute center for the Danish Defense in the coming decades." Like '
         "the F-16 before it, the F-35 is spearheading NATO's air power and "
         'ensuring\xa0strategic integration of allied combat airpower. The '
         'vital interoperability of the 5th Generation F-35 binds 13 allies '
         'and partners with\xa0the United States\xa0in air dominance and '
         'enabling critical joint capabilities.\xa0The F-35 will serve as a '
         'force multiplier for\xa0Denmark, allowing the Royal Danish Air Force '
         'to train and fight alongside NATO allies and create a strong '
         'deterrent. "The F-35 will ensure Denmark\'s sovereignty and air '
         'dominance, enhance its multidomain and network-based coalition '
         'operations, and play a pivotal role in keeping the Arctic a secure '
         'and stable region," said Greg Ulmer , executive vice president, '
         'Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. "This game-changing capability would '
         'not be possible without the unwavering support of the Danish '
         'government and the innovative contributions of Danish industry." '
         'Senior government and military leaders from Denmark and the United '
         'States attended the ceremony. A replay of the event is available '
         'here . Danish industry serves as a critical partner with the F-35 '
         'Lightning II program through high technology work, ensuring '
         'competitiveness and defense industry viability in\xa0Denmark. Two '
         'Danish companies, Terma A/S and Multicut A/S, are currently making '
         'parts such as pylons, advanced composites, software solutions, radar '
         'components and horizontal tail edges for every F-35 delivered. '
         "Denmark's F-35 program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft, each "
         'of which will be built at Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth . The first '
         'aircraft will be delivered to Luke Air Force Base, Arizona , later '
         'this month where Danish pilots and maintainers will begin training. '
         'With stealth technology, supersonic speed, advanced sensors, weapons '
         'capacity and increased range, the F-35 is the most advanced, '
         'survivable and connected aircraft in the world. More than a fighter '
         "jet, the F-35's ability to collect, analyze and share data, is a "
         'powerful force multiplier that enhances all airborne, surface and '
         'ground-based assets in the battlespace enabling men and women in '
         'uniform to execute their mission and return home safely. To date, '
         'Lockheed Martin has delivered more than 625 F-35s, trained more than '
         '1,300 pilots and 10,380 maintainers, and the F-35 fleet has flown '

 'text': 'MELBOURNE/CANBERRA, Australia, April 21, 2021 – Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE: LMT) and Thales Australia have finalized a teaming agreement '
         'advancing the delivery of an Australian guided weapons manufacturing '
         'capability in support of a sovereign national guided weapons '
         'enterprise. The agreement will see experienced strategic industry '
         'partners in Lockheed Martin and Thales Australia cooperate in the '
         'design, development and production of Lockheed Martin’s Long Range '
         'Anti-Ship Missile – Surface Launch (LRASM SL) variant, with a '
         'specific focus on booster and rocket motor technologies. Lockheed '
         'Martin and Thales Australia have unique and complementary '
         'backgrounds and expertise in the manufacture and delivery of weapons '
         'capabilities that together will provide further impetus for the '
         'Australian Government’s objective of expanding the sovereign defence '
         'industrial and manufacturing capability. It will bring Australia a '
         'step closer to a sovereign guided weapons capability. This teaming '
         'agreement advances the proven and mature LRASM maritime strike '
         'capability across further platforms for the next generation of '
         'surface and ground launch domains. Joe North, Chief Executive, '
         'Lockheed Martin Australia, said that the teaming agreement '
         'represents not only a significant commitment to the delivery of '
         'sovereign guided weapons manufacturing capabilities in Australia but '
         'recognises that local industry is also investing in opportunities '
         'for local manufacturing and production. “This is a step change for '
         'future weapons manufacture in Australia – through technology '
         'transfer and innovation we see the opportunity to drive the creation '
         'of a skilled local workforce, build resiliency in supply chains and '
         'help secure Australia’s sovereign defence capabilities for now and '
         'into the future,” said North. “We are delighted to be teaming with '
         'Thales Australia and our agreement acknowledges the confidence we '
         'have in Thales Australia and its’ strong safety culture in the '
         'delivery of weapons capabilities.” “Lockheed Martin has a proud '
         'history of successfully developing and delivering world class '
         'capabilities to our customers. The opportunity to work with the team '
         'at Thales Australia, the largest manufacturer of explosive ordnance '
         'to the Australian Defence Force, with a successful track record of '
         'delivering ammunition, propellants, explosives and related services '
         'has the makings of a great partnership for the future.” Chris '
         'Jenkins, Chief Executive Officer at Thales Australia said the '
         'development of booster and rocket motor technology for the LRASM '
         'under the teaming agreement with Lockheed Martin was an indicator of '
         'the advanced R&D and industrial capabilities offered by Thales '
         'Australia to support a sovereign guided weapons manufacturing '
         'capability. “High performance propellants and explosives for '
         'warheads, solid fuel rocket motor manufacturing and associated R&D '
         'and support services delivered by Thales Australia are essential to '
         'achieve sovereign guided weapons capability and we are looking '
         'forward to working with Lockheed Martin in support of the Australian '
         'Defence Force’s (ADF) objectives. “Thales currently employs over 650 '
         'skilled staff to manufacture munitions systems for the ADF and '
         'allied forces. And we work with over 500 Australian small and medium '
         'enterprises and a large range of weapons systems Primes to ensure '
         'the ADF receives the locally manufactured munitions they need. '
         '“Through the signing of this agreement with Lockheed Martin, we look '

         'under contract to manufacture a total of 23 VH-92A® Presidential '
         'Helicopters for the U.S. Marine Corps. Sikorsky is on schedule to '

         'The award announced February 5, 2021 by the U.S. Navy for five '
         'aircraft is the final lot of VH-92A presidential helicopters set to '
         'deliver in 2023. \xa0Sikorsky’s highly skilled workforce is '
         'completing final modifications on 12 of the production aircraft at '
         'its manufacturing facility in Stratford, Connecticut and Owego, New '
         'York. “This contract to build more presidential helicopters shows '
         'our customer values Sikorsky’s proven record of supporting this no '
         'fail mission for decades and is confident in our ability to innovate '
         'and deliver this next generation aircraft flying the president well '

         'has a special place in the hearts of our employees who treasure the '
         'legacy and look forward to watching the new White Top enter '

         'white and green livery, will continue this legacy for decades to '
         'come. The VH-92A program ensures long-term affordability and '
         'maintainability by utilizing the FAA certified Sikorsky S-92 '

 'text': 'DALLAS , Mar. 29, 2021 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) received a '
         '$1.12 billion contract from the U.S. Army for Lot 16 production of '
         'Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets and associated '
         'equipment. The contract calls for the production of more than 9,000 '
         'GMLRS Unitary and Alternative-Warhead (AW) rockets, more than 2,000 '
         'Low-Cost Reduced-Range Practice Rockets (RRPRs) and integrated '
         'logistics support for the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and '
         'international customers. Work will be performed at the Lockheed '
         'Martin facilities in Camden, Arkansas; Dallas and Lufkin, Texas; and '
         'Ocala, Florida, and will be completed by September 2023. “GMLRS’s '
         'versatile rounds provide proven capability, unmatched accuracy and '
         'are engineered for future needs in support of Joint All-Domain '
         'Operations (JADO),” said Gaylia Campbell, vice president of '
         'Precision Fires and Combat Maneuver Systems at Lockheed Martin '
         'Missiles and Fire Control. “GMLRS remains in high demand because '
         'it’s the right round for multiple types of missions. Our focus '
         'remains on producing the combat-proven, cost-effective GMLRS to meet '
         'our customers’ needs.” Recently, Lockheed Martin delivered the '
         '50,000th GMLRS to the U.S. Army customer – a milestone that '
         'represents the unmatched legacy of precision fires excellence that '
         'continues to evolve alongside the 21st Century Warfighter. GMLRS is '
         'an all-weather rocket designed for fast deployment that delivers '
         'precision strike beyond the reach of most conventional weapons. The '
         'munition is the primary round for the combat-proven Lockheed Martin '
         'produced HIMARS and MLRS family of launchers and features a Global '
         'Positioning System (GPS) aided inertial guidance package and small '
         'maneuvering canards on the rocket nose, which add maneuverability to '
         'enhance the accuracy of the system. The GMLRS AW was developed to '
         'service area targets without the effects of unexploded ordinance. '
         'GMLRS unitary rockets provide precision strike for point targets, '
         'exceed the required combat reliability rate and are cost-effective. '
         'The Reduced-Range Practice Rocket allows users to train with '
         'realistic, full-motored rockets with limited flight range, making '
         'them ideal for smaller testing ranges. Lockheed Martin is also '
         'developing the Extended Range (ER) GMLRS that will provide the same '
         'accuracy and reliability the munition is known for while '
         'significantly extending the range – reaching 150 kilometers. For '
         'more than 40 years, Lockheed Martin has been the leading designer '
         'and manufacturer of long-range, surface-to-surface precision strike '
         'solutions, providing highly reliable, combat-proven systems like '

 'text': 'DENVER , March 1, 2021 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'and NEC Corporation (NEC; TSE: 6701) have signed a joint '
         "collaboration agreement to extend their partnership utilizing NEC's "
         'System Invariant Analysis Technology (SIAT). The companies are also '
         'finalizing a licensing agreement with a multi-year option. With a '
         'focus on driving speed and efficiency of system diagnostics, this '
         'partnership will continue to provide proven artificial intelligence '
         '(AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities across product '
         'lifecycles. This positively impacts design and production phases of '
         "spacecraft development, including applications on NASA's Orion "
         'vehicle for the Artemis mission. "The power of AI is leveraged '
         'across our entire enterprise, and with a trusted partner like NEC, '
         'we gain the resources to expand its abilities at scale across our '
         'internal operations,"\xa0said Rick Ambrose , executive vice '
         'president of Lockheed Martin Space. "By proactively analyzing '
         'telemetry data we are able to deliver our systems even faster and '
         'streamline the work that our employees do every day." For several '
         'years, Lockheed Martin and NEC have been working together to '
         'evaluate the effectiveness\xa0of SIAT for early production testing '
         'and operational scenarios. As a result, Lockheed Martin has '
         'integrated SIAT into the Technology for Telemetry Analytics for '
         'Universal Artificial Intelligence (T-TAURI) AI service. This allows '
         'the organization to drive proactive anomaly detection during the '
         'design, development, production and test phase of spacecraft '
         "development – even before applications in mission operations. NEC's "
         'SIAT advanced analytics engine uses data collected from sensors to '
         'learn the behavior of systems, including computer systems, power '
         'plants, factories and buildings, enabling the system itself to '
         'automatically detect inconsistencies and prescribe resolutions. By '
         "integrating within Lockheed Martin's T-TAURI platform, a "
         'comprehensive time series analysis framework, the team can gain an '
         'exhaustive, holistic understanding of a system, creating a '
         'foundational system for other advanced technologies like '
         'system-level digital twins. Since the initial partnership between '
         'NEC and Lockheed Martin, the teams have already seen applications '
         'for early pathfinding to detect production anomalies and software '
         'regression testing. "We\'re thrilled that the innovative SIAT '
         'developed by NEC provides value to Lockheed Martin as it addresses '
         'not only the development of complex systems, but also the uniqueness '
         'of deep space exploration," said Motoo Nishihara , executive vice '
         'president, CTO and Member of the Board, NEC Corporation.\xa0'
         '"Together, we are committed to strengthening our solution and '
         'finding new ways to apply this technology." Proven AI Results '
         'Lockheed Martin has already successfully applied this technology on '
         'several operations to date. For example, the team used it to analyze '
         'the unprecedented amount of data that was produced by the Orion '
         'vehicle during testing. Within a four-hour period, T-TAURI and SIAT '
         "built a model of the vehicle's normal operations from nearly 150,000 "
         'sensors to establish over 22 billion logical relationships for '
         'analysis. The resulting models can be used to monitor all future '
         'tests of subsequent vehicles to compare expected and irregular '
         'behavior to analyze consistency and aid in regression analysis. '
         'Without these advanced AI and ML tools, it would be impossible for a '
         'single engineer to analyze massive amounts of data manually at the '
         'speed needed to analyze the data in its entirety. Going forward, AI '
         'will continue to be applied on future missions in several ways, '
         'including future ground station support for customer satellite '
         'operations as well as expanding the application for human-rated '
         'systems to demonstrate an increase in speed of anomaly detection and '

 'text': "DENVER , Jan. 14, 2021 / PRNewswire / -- NASA's Orion spacecraft is "
         'ready for its mission to the Moon. Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] has '
         'completed assembly and testing of the Orion Artemis I spacecraft and '
         "has transferred possession to NASA's Exploration Ground Systems "
         '(EGS) team today. Assembled at Kennedy Space Center, the EGS team '
         'will then perform final preparations on the spacecraft for its '
         'mission to the Moon later this year.     Ready for the Moon Orion is '
         "NASA's new human-rated exploration-class spaceship that will take "
         'astronauts into deep space including the Moon and Mars. Lockheed '
         'Martin is the prime contractor for NASA and built the crew module, '
         'crew module adaptor and launch abort system. The European Space '
         'Agency provides the European Service Module for Orion. The Artemis I '
         'mission will be the first launch of the Orion spacecraft aboard '
         "NASA's Space Launch System rocket. Over the course of three weeks, "
         'the uncrewed Orion capsule will fly out and orbit the Moon and '
         'return to Earth. This test mission will validate the spacecraft, '
         'rocket and ground systems for future crewed missions . "Orion is a '
         'unique and impressive spacecraft and the team did an outstanding job '
         'to get us to this day," said Mike Hawes , Orion vice president and '
         'program manager for Lockheed Martin. "The launch and flight of '
         'Artemis I will be an impressive sight, but more importantly it will '
         'confirm Orion is ready to safely carry humans to the Moon and back '
         'home. This tremendous advancement opens the door to a new era of '
         'deep space exploration that will ultimately benefit us back here on '
         'Earth." Orion is being transferred from the Neil Armstrong '
         'Operations and Checkout Building at Kennedy, where it was assembled, '
         'to multiple Kennedy facilities where EGS will load propellants and '
         'other consumables such as ammonia, helium and nitrogen, and '
         'integrate the launch abort system and protective ogive fairing. '
         'After this is completed, it will be taken to the Vertical Assembly '
         'Facility to be lifted onto the SLS rocket and prepared for roll to '
         'the launch pad. Crewed Missions Underway The launch later this year '
         'will be the beginning of many Artemis missions to the Moon. The next '
         'mission, Artemis II, will be the first with a crew onboard and will '
         'go out to orbit the Moon and return. That Orion crew module and '
         'service module adapter are well under assembly at Kennedy and will '
         'see its first power-on of its integrated computers this summer. '
         'Artemis III will see the first woman and the next man to walk on the '
         'Moon. Orion will carry them out to orbit the Moon where they will '
         'ultimately land on the surface using a lunar landing system. That '
         'spacecraft is already under construction as major structural '
         "elements of the crew module pressure vessel are arriving at NASA's "
         'Michoud Assembly Facility. As part of an Orion production and '
         'operations contract , NASA ordered three Orion spacecraft from '
         'Lockheed Martin for Artemis missions III-V with plans to order three '
         'additional Orion spacecraft for Artemis missions VI-VIII and options '
         'for up to 12 missions. More information about Orion: Lockheed Martin '

         'a Lockheed Martin Company (NYSE: LMT), and Boeing (NYSE: BA) today '
         "released details of its advanced helicopter for the U.S. Army's "
         'Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft competition, known as FLRAA. The '
         'aircraft, named DEFIANT X, will be the fastest, most maneuverable '
         'and most survivable assault helicopter in history. Combined with the '
         "team's unsurpassed experience in mission systems, training and "
         'sustainment, it will revolutionize the way the Army meets threats in '
         '2035 and beyond. DEFIANT X is a complete weapon system that builds '
         'on the handling qualities and transformational capabilities proven '
         "by the team's technology demonstrator, SB>1 DEFIANT®. With unmatched "
         'range and survivability, DEFIANT X will change the way the Army '
         'fights – enabling crews to fly low and fast through complex terrain, '
         'land quickly, deliver Soldiers and equipment to the objective area '
         '(referred to as "the X") and get out. DEFIANT X flies twice as far '
         'and fast as the venerable Black Hawk® helicopter it is designed to '
         'replace. Currently undergoing testing in a digital combat '
         'environment, the aircraft continues to prove itself the most '
         'survivable platform for mission requirements. View the video . "We '
         'are ready to deliver unparalleled capabilities backed by proven '
         "technologies that will truly transform the Army's mission today, "
         'with room to grow and adapt to the missions of tomorrow," said Andy '
         'Adams , Sikorsky vice president of Future Vertical Lift. "DEFIANT X '
         'not only includes the transformational aircraft – a maneuverable, '
         "survivable, lethal weapon system – it also leverages Sikorsky's and "
         'Boeing\'s advanced manufacturing capabilities." With its rigid '
         'coaxial rotor system and pusher propeller, DEFIANT X incorporates '
         'Sikorsky X2 Technology™ to operate at high speeds while maintaining '
         'low-speed handling qualities. This critical capability provides '
         'Soldiers with increased maneuverability and survivability in '
         'high-threat air defense environments, allowing them to penetrate '
         'enemy defenses while reducing exposure to enemy fire. Compared to '
         'SB>1 DEFIANT, the DEFIANT X airframe has enhancements to improve '
         'aerodynamics and reduce the thermal signature. "DEFIANT X is '
         'purpose-built for a modernized Army that requires expanded reach, '
         'survivability and lethality," said Steve Parker , vice president and '
         'general manager of Boeing Vertical Lift. "This weapon system will\xa0'
         'give Soldiers unequaled technological advantage and connectivity '
         'over adversaries in a multi-domain battle space." DEFIANT X will '
         "revolutionize the Army's air assault capability with limited changes "
         'in tactics, techniques, procedures, training and infrastructure '
         'while maintaining the Black Hawk helicopter footprint and tight '
         'formation capability flown today. The Army is expected to release a '
         'request for proposal on FLRAA later this year, with a contract award '
         'expected in 2022. About Sikorsky and Boeing Together, Sikorsky and '
         "Boeing have built 90 percent of the U.S. Army's current military "
         "rotorcraft and have totaled more than 15 million flight hours. We're "
         'the team that has brought forward iconic military rotorcraft '
         'including: Black Hawk, Chinook and Apache. The iconic UH-60 Black '
         'Hawk has proven itself to be the premiere assault platform in the '
         'world and DEFIANT X will bring the next level of capability that the '

         'of the U.S. and its allies and to the continuation of scientific '
         'discovery. In concert with our resilient operational performance, we '
         'delivered strong financial results on behalf of our shareholders and '
         'contributed to our communities through the production of PPE, '
         'accelerated payments to small and medium businesses, and elevated '
         'charitable contributions to support a range of important local and '

         'previously announced, on Dec. 20, 2020 , the corporation entered '
         'into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. '
         '(Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $56 per share in cash, which is expected to '
         'be reduced to $51 per share after Aerojet Rocketdyne pays a '
         'pre-closing special dividend to its stockholders on March 24, 2021 . '
         'This represents a post-dividend equity value of approximately $4.6 '
         'billion , on a fully diluted as-converted basis, and a transaction '
         'value of approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet '
         "Rocketdyne's projected net cash balance. The corporation expects to "
         'finance the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and '
         'new debt issuances. The acquisition provides the corporation the '
         "opportunity to integrate Aerojet Rocketdyne's propulsion systems "
         'more effectively into its products, generate cost and revenue '
         "synergies, and improve efficiencies in Aerojet Rocketdyne's "
         'production operations. The transaction will also allow customers '
         'incorporating Aerojet Rocketdyne products to offer more timely, '
         'innovative and affordable solutions, and reduce the prices paid by '
         'the U.S. Government for systems it buys. The transaction is expected '
         'to close in the second half of 2021 and is subject to the '
         'satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory '

         'outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a '
         'pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency '
         'by the U.S. Government in March 2020 and has negatively affected the '
         'U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, resulted '
         'in significant travel and transport restrictions, including mandated '
         'closures and orders to "shelter-in-place" and quarantine '
         'restrictions. Lockheed Martin has taken measures to protect the '
         'health and safety of its employees, work with its customers and '
         'suppliers to minimize disruptions and support its community in '
         'addressing the challenges posed by this ongoing global pandemic. The '
         'pandemic has presented unprecedented business challenges, and the '
         'corporation has experienced impacts in each business area related to '
         'COVID-19, primarily in increased coronavirus-related costs, delays '
         'in supplier deliveries, impacts of travel restrictions, site access '
         'and quarantine requirements, and the impacts of remote work and '
         'adjusted work schedules. Despite these challenges, the corporation '
         "and the U.S. Government's pro-active efforts, especially with regard "
         'to the supply chain, helped to partially mitigate the disruptions '
         "caused by COVID-19 on the corporation's operations in 2020. In "
         'addition, favorable contract award timing, strong operational '
         'performance and lower travel and overhead expenditures due to '
         'COVID-19 restrictions partially offset the impacts of COVID-19 on '
         "the corporation's financial results in 2020. However, the ultimate "
         'impact of COVID-19 in future periods remains uncertain. The '
         "corporation's 2021 financial outlook assumes, among other things, "
         'that its production facilities continue to operate and it does not '
         'experience significant work stoppages or closures, it is able to '
         'mitigate any supply chain disruptions and these do not worsen, and '
         'government funding priorities do not change. Working with its U.S. '
         'Government customers, the corporation continues to monitor COVID-19 '
         'risks and impacts as well as explore potential paths to recover any '
         "cost impacts. While these are the corporation's current assumptions, "
         'they could change and will depend on future pandemic related '
         'developments, including the duration of the pandemic, any potential '
         'subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection, the effectiveness, '
         'distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, and related '
         "government actions. Cash Activities The corporation's cash "

         'earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating '
         'activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations '
         "of its business segments. Operating profit of the corporation's "
         'business segments also excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment '
         'described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered '
         'allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under '
         'the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or '
         'federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not '
         "considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating "
         'performance such as a portion of management and administration '
         'costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, stock-based '
         'compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance '
         'actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from '
         'significant divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate '
         'activities. The corporation recovers CAS pension cost through the '
         'pricing of its products and services on U.S. Government contracts '
         'and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension cost in each of its business '
         "segments' net sales and cost of sales. The corporation's "
         'consolidated financial statements must present pension and other '
         'postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with '
         'U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as FAS '
         'expense). The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension '
         'adjustment represents the difference between the service cost '
         'component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost. The '
         'non-service FAS pension expense components are included in other '
         'non-operating expense. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases '
         'or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense '
         '(both service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating '
         'profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume '
         'refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit '
         'resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or '
         'service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment '
         'operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking '
         'rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of the '
         "corporation's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin "
         'may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit '
         "booking rates on the corporation's contracts for which it recognizes "
         'revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost '
         'method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in profit '
         'booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually '
         'relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the '
         'performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a '
         'particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract '
         'may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total '
         'costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the '
         'profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates '
         'are recognized in the current period and reflect the '
         'inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit '
         'and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other '
         'items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may '
         'include the positive resolution of contractual matters, insurance '
         'recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may '
         'include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring '
         'charges, except for significant severance actions which are excluded '
         'from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset '
         'impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. The '
         "corporation's consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, "
         'including net profit booking rate adjustments, represented '
         'approximately 25 percent and 26 percent of total segment operating '

         'an insurance company. As a result of this transaction, the insurance '
         'company assumed the outstanding pension obligations and is now '
         'required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to these '
         'retirees and beneficiaries. The second transaction requires another '
         'insurance company to reimburse our pension trust fund for all future '
         'benefit payments made to approximately 2,500 U.S. retirees and '
         'beneficiaries under a group annuity contract purchased for $793 '
         'million . Under the terms of this transaction, the plan retains the '
         'outstanding pension obligations and will continue to pay and '
         'administer the retirement benefits to these retirees and '
         'beneficiaries but will be reimbursed for all future benefit payments '
         'covered by the contract with no net ongoing cash funding obligation '

 'text': 'HARWELL ,\xa0Oxford, Feb. 8, 2021 – Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] has '
         'contracted ABL Space Systems, of El Segundo, California, a developer '
         'of low-cost launch vehicles and launch systems for the small '
         'satellite industry, to supply a rocket and associated launch '
         'services for the company’s first UK vertical satellite launch. The '
         'project known as UK Pathfinder Launch is planned to be the first '
         'ever vertical small satellite launch from UK soil, from Scotland in '
         '2022. It will also be the first UK commercial launch for U.S.-based '
         'ABL Space Systems’ new RS1 rocket. Nik Smith, Regional Director, '
         'Lockheed Martin Space, said: “We are absolutely committed to the '
         'success of this programme and the world class capability that ABL '
         'Space Systems brings will allow us to build on our long-standing '
         'partnership with the UK and strengthen the growth of the UK space '
         'sector, aligned to the UK Government’s prosperity and industrial '
         'strategy.” ABL Space Systems’ flexible, integrated GS0 launch '
         'system, and RS1 rocket, allows for a rapid and cost-effective '
         'deployment with outstanding launch performance. “ABL Space Systems '
         'is proud to partner with Lockheed Martin on the UK Pathfinder Launch '
         'Program," said Harry O\'Hanley, co-Founder and CEO of ABL Space '
         'Systems. "Our team was founded to deliver new launch capabilities, '
         "on-demand. We're thrilled at the opportunity bring our system to "
         'Shetland’s launch site and execute this ground-breaking mission with '
         'our partners.” Lockheed Martin’s UK Pathfinder Launch supports the '
         'UK Space Agency’s commercial spaceflight programme – Launch UK. In '
         'October, the UK Space Agency confirmed Lockheed Martin’s plans to '
         'move its programme to the Shetland Space Centre and in January, '
         'planning proposals were submitted for the space launch facility in '
         'Unst. Ian Annett, Deputy CEO, UK Space Agency said: “We want the UK '
         'to be the first in Europe to launch small satellites into orbit, '
         'attracting innovative businesses from all over the world, '
         'accelerating the development of new technologies and creating '
         'hundreds of high-skilled jobs across the whole of the UK. Lockheed '
         'Martin’s selection of ABL Space Systems for their UK Pathfinder '
         'launch brings us one step closer to realising this ambition – '
         'putting the UK firmly on the map as Europe’s leading small satellite '
         'launch destination. “In this challenging time, it’s more important '
         'than ever that we support technologies that will help create jobs '
         'and economic growth, enabling people and businesses across the '
         'country to benefit from the commercial opportunities offered by the '
         'UK’s growing space sector and the many firms throughout its supply '
         'chain.” The addition of ABL Space Systems as a partner completes '
         'Lockheed Martin’s UK Pathfinder Launch programme team. On launch '
         'day, ABL Space Systems’ RS1 rocket will lift off from Shetland Space '
         "Centre, in Unst, Shetland, the UK's most northerly island. Once in "
         'orbit, the rocket will release a small launch orbital manoeuvring '
         'vehicle, an agile platform built by MOOG, in Reading, UK, which can '
         'carry and deploy up to six 6U CubeSats, optimising orbital placement '
         'and timing for each small satellite’s respective missions. To '
         'demonstrate the full value of this new UK space transportation '
         'capability, two of the CubeSats deployed will be Lockheed Martin’s '
         'own technology demonstration spacecraft. In 2019, ABL Space Systems '
         'announced that it had received a strategic investment from Lockheed '
         'Martin Ventures to advance the launch provider’s development and '
         'test programme. About ABL Space Systems ABL Space Systems was '

 'text': 'Sikorsky und die Mitglieder des deutschen CH-53K-Industrieteams '
         'haben ihren Willen zur Kooperation durch ein neues Teaming-Agreement '
         'bekräftigt. Christian Albrecht, International Business Development '
         'Manager bei Sikorsky: „Wir haben intensiv und in enger Abstimmung an '
         'einem Konzept gearbeitet, wie man den schweren Transporthubschrauber '
         'CH-53K bestmöglich betreiben und instandhalten kann. Die deutsche '
         'Industrie ist dafür der perfekte Partner und gewährleistet darüber '
         'hinaus ein größtmögliches Maß an Unabhängigkeit von ausländischen '
         'Unternehmen. Umso mehr freuen wir uns, dass wir zuletzt einen '
         'weiteren exklusiven Partner gewinnen konnten,“ sagte Albrecht. Der '
         'US-Hubschrauberhersteller bewirbt sich um die Lieferung des neuen '
         'Schweren Transporthubschraubers (STH) an die Bundeswehr. Sikorsky '
         'hatte dazu frühzeitig ein Team führender deutscher '
         'Technologieunternehmen gebildet, zu dem neben Rheinmetall auch MTU '
         'Aero Engines, Autoflug und Hydro Systems zählen – und nun auch die '
         'Reiser Simulation and Training. Der bayerische Mittelständler '
         'verstärkt das deutsche CH-53K-Industrieteam als Unterauftragnehmer '
         'von Rheinmetall. Mike Schmidt, Geschäftsführer der Rheinmetall '
         'Aviation Services GmbH„Die Reiser Simulation and Training GmbH ist '
         'ein ausgewiesener Spezialist der deutschen Luftfahrtindustrie. '
         'Rheinmetall und Reiser werden ihre technologische Erfahrung im '
         'Bereich Training und Simulation bündeln und auf diese Weise ein '
         'hochqualitatives Angebot unterbreiten, das sämtlichen Standards der '
         'Bundeswehr entspricht.“ Im Fall der CH-53K erfüllt die Basisversion '
         'schon heute alle relevanten Fähigkeitsanforderungen der Bundeswehr. '
         'Ein wesentlicher Grund hierfür ist unter anderem die serienmäßig '
         'verfügbare Luftbetankungssonde und der dadurch stark erweiterte '
         'Einsatzradius der CH-53K. CH-53K: Hoher Wertschöpfungsanteil in '
         'Deutschland Die substanzielle Beteiligung zahlreicher deutscher '
         'Unternehmen unterstreicht auch die Bedeutung des Projekts für den '
         'Industriestandort Deutschland. Sollte die Bundeswehr den '
         'Transporthubschrauber beschaffen, würde ein Großteil der '
         'Wertschöpfung der CH-53K in Deutschland geschehen. Für die deutsche '
         'Industrie wären damit neue langfristige Arbeitsplätze im '
         'Hochtechnologiebereich und ein wichtiger Knowhow-Transfer verbunden. '
         'Reiser wird seine Kompetenz im Bereich Ausbildung und Simulation in '
         'das Projekt einbringen – insbesondere bei Simulationsangeboten und '
         'technischen Lösungen für die Ausbildung des Wartungspersonals. Das '
         'Unternehmen ist ein bewährter Partner für Ausbildungssysteme der '
         'Bundeswehr etwa im Projekt NH90 für das Heer und die Marine sowie '
         'beim Eurofighter für die Luftwaffe. Reiser ergänzt damit im Vorhaben '
         'STH in idealer Weise die Kompetenzen von Rheinmetall auf dem Gebiet '
         'der Simulation. Mit Blick auf den fortgeschrittenen Projektverlauf '
         'erklärte Dr. Roman Sperl, Geschäftsführer der Reiser Simulation and '
         'Training GmbH, jetzt sei genau die richtige Zeit, dem '
         'erfolgsversprechenden und ungemein leistungsstarken Industrieteam '
         'beizutreten. „Wir freuen uns sehr, nun Teil des CH-53K-Teams zu '
         'sein. Wir sind geübt in der Zusammenarbeit mit Rheinmetall und '
         'werden gemeinsam zur maximalen Erhöhung der Einsatzbereitschaft der '
         'CH-53K beitragen.“ Sperl weiter: „Dieser Helikopter setzt einen ganz '
         'neuen technologischen Standard. Die Bundeswehr ist aus unserer Sicht '
         'gut beraten, sich für das innovativste Produkt und das beste '
         'deutsche Industrieteam zu entscheiden.“ Die CH-53K („King Stallion“) '
         'ist der derzeit modernste, intelligenteste und leistungsstärkste '
         'Großhubschrauber im Markt. Die Serienfertigung der CH-53K in den USA '
         'schreitet planmäßig voran. Aktuell befinden sich mehr als 30 '
         'Luftfahrzeuge in verschiedenen Produktionsstufen. Die Verlegung der '
         'ersten CH-53K in den Einsatz ist für 2023/24 vorgesehen. ÜBER DAS '
         'DEUTSCHE CH-53K-TEAM Sikorsky hat frühzeitig ein deutsches '
         'Industrieteam geformt und dafür gesorgt, dass die Expertise der '
         'lokalen Partner direkt in die Bewerbung einfließt. Ein Großteil der '
         'Wertschöpfung des Projekts wird somit in Deutschland entstehen. Das '
         'deutsche CH-53K-Team wird angeführt von Rheinmetall. Weitere '
         'Teammitglieder sind unter anderem Autoflug, Collins Aerospace, '
         'Hensoldt, HYDRO Systems, MTU Aero Engines, Rohde & Schwarz, '
         'Vincorion, ZFL und Reiser. Das deutsch-amerikanische CH-53K-Team '
         'bildet die Grundvoraussetzung für ein erfolgreiches STH-Programm und '
         'gewährleistet eine hohe Verfügbarkeit des Hubschraubers sowie '
         'zuverlässige Unterstützung und Wartung – über die gesamte '
         'Nutzungsdauer des Hubschraubers hinweg.',

 'text': 'Teaming agreement renewed: Sikorsky and Rheinmetall continue to '
         'count on German industrial team. Bavarian company Reiser supports '
         'instruction and training of maintenance staff '
         'Berlin/Düsseldorf/Berg, January 27, 2021 – Sikorsky and the members '
         'of the German CH-53K industry team have reaffirmed their commitment '
         'to cooperation through a new teaming agreement. Christian Albrecht, '
         'International Business Development Manager at Sikorsky: "We have '
         'been working intensively and in close coordination to develop a '
         'concept on how to best operate and maintain the CH-53K heavy-lift '
         'helicopter. The German industry is the perfect partner for this and '
         'guarantees the greatest possible degree of independence from foreign '
         'companies. We are all the more pleased that we have recently been '
         'able to win another exclusive team member," said Albrecht. The US '
         'helicopter manufacturer is offering the production and delivery of '
         'the Sikorsky CH-53K (King Stallion) as the Bundeswehr’s new '
         'heavy-lift helicopter. To this end, Sikorsky had formed a team of '
         'leading German technology companies at an early stage, including '
         'Rheinmetall, MTU Aero Engines, Autoflug and Hydro Systems - and now '
         'also Reiser Simulation and Training. The Bavarian medium-sized '
         'company is strengthening the German CH-53K industrial team as a '
         'subcontractor to Rheinmetall. Mike Schmidt, Managing Director of '
         'Rheinmetall Aviation Services GmbH: "Reiser Simulation and Training '
         'GmbH is a proven specialist in the German aviation industry. '
         'Rheinmetall and Reiser will combine their technological experience '
         'in the field of training and simulation and together provide a '
         'high-quality offering that meets all the standards of the '
         'Bundeswehr." In the case of the CH-53K, the basic version already '
         'fulfils all relevant mission requirements of the Bundeswehr. One of '
         'the major reasons for this is the CH-53K’s air-to-air refueling '
         'capability which is available as standard, and which greatly expands '
         'the aircrafts operational range. CH-53K: Substantial workshare in '
         'Germany The substantial participation of numerous German companies '
         'also underlines the importance of the project for Germany as an '
         'industry location. Should the Bundeswehr procure the transport '
         'helicopter, a large part of the value creation of the CH-53K would '
         'take place in Germany. For German industry, this would mean new '
         'long-term jobs in the high-tech sector and an important transfer of '
         'know-how. Reiser will contribute its expertise in the field of '
         'training and simulation to the project – especially in simulation '
         'offers and technical solutions for training maintenance personnel. '
         'The company is a proven partner for Bundeswehr training systems and '
         "complements Rheinmetall's expertise in the field of simulation in "
         'the STH project. Given the advanced progress of the project, Dr '
         'Roman Sperl, Managing Director of Reiser Simulation and Training '
         'GmbH, said now was exactly the right time to join the promising and '
         'powerful industry team: "We are very excited to be part of the '
         'CH-53K team now. We are experienced in working with Rheinmetall and '
         'together we will contribute to ensuring maximum operational '
         'readiness of the CH-53K." Sperl was convinced by the performance of '
         'the Sikorsky helicopter: "This helicopter sets a whole new '
         'technological standard. In our view, the Bundeswehr is well advised '
         'to choose the most innovative product and the best German industrial '
         'team." The CH-53K ("King Stallion") is the most modern, intelligent '
         'and powerful heavy-lift helicopter on the market. The CH-53K is '
         'ramping up production with more than 30 aircraft in various stages '
         'of build and is on track for deployment in 2023/24. The CH-53K has '
         'achieved many milestones demonstrating its unique capabilities, '
         'including extensive fly-by-wire tests, initial sea trials and '
         'air-to-air refueling, as well as further exercises under operational '
         'conditions. Military aircrews and technicians are now training in '
         'preparation for initial operational testing this spring. ABOUT THE '
         'GERMAN CH-53K TEAM Sikorsky formed a German industrial team early on '
         'and ensured that the expertise of local partners was incorporated '
         'directly into its bid. A large part of the added value of the '
         'project will be generated in Germany. The German CH-53K team is led '
         'by Rheinmetall. Other team members include Autoflug, Collins '
         'Aerospace, Hensoldt, HYDRO Systems, MTU Aero Engines, Rohde & '
         'Schwarz, Vincorion, ZFL and Reiser. The German-US CH-53K team is the '
         'prerequisite for a successful STH program and ensures high '
         'availability of the helicopter as well as reliable support and '
         'maintenance - throughout the entire service life of the helicopter.',

 'text': 'FORT WORTH, Texas , Jan. 6, 2021 / PRNewswire / --\xa0The F-35 Joint '
         'Program Office awarded the Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) industry team '
         'a $1.28 billion Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) to support '
         'operations and sustainment of the global F-35 fleet through June 30, '
         '2021 .     "This contract ensures F-35s remain ready to fly and '
         'accomplish the warfighter\'s mission," said Bill Brotherton , '
         'Lockheed Martin F-35 program acting vice president and general '
         'manager. "We continue to see improvements in readiness and cost, and '
         'as the fleet grows, so does the opportunity for the joint government '
         'and industry team to collaborate, realizing even more long-term '
         'benefits." The UCA provides initial critical sustainment activities '
         'for a worldwide fleet while negotiations continue on a long-term '
         'contract to build enterprise capacity and affordability to support '
         'the future fleet of more than 3,000 F-35 aircraft. The UCA funds '
         'industry sustainment experts supporting operations worldwide, '
         'individual bases, depot maintenance, pilot and maintainer training, '
         'and sustainment engineering across the globe. It also covers '
         'fleet-wide data analytics and supply chain management for part '
         'repair and replenishment to enhance overall supply availability. The '
         'F-35 Joint Program Office, together with each U.S. Service, '
         'international operators and the F-35 industry team, leads F-35 '
         'sustainment and the Global Support Solution. Readiness in Action '
         'Lockheed Martin and industry teammates BAE Systems and Northrop '
         'Grumman provide critical sustainment support for over 600 aircraft '
         'in key areas such as training, base operations, repairs, global '
         'supply, and sustainment support to F-35 customers. While many think '
         'of sustainment as all of the activity after aircraft delivery, it '
         'actually begins the moment a requirement is written and design '
         'starts. The fifth generation F-35 is designed and produced with '
         "mission readiness and the warfighter's success in mind. The F-35's "
         'reliability continues to improve, and newer production aircraft are '
         'averaging greater than 70% mission capable rates, with some '
         'operational squadrons consistently near 75%. Cost per flight hour '
         'has decreased by more than 40% during the last five years. To '
         'further improve readiness and cost stability, the enterprise is '
         'conducting supply chain competitions and building supply capacity, '
         'synchronizing spare buys, improving parts reliability and '
         'maintainability, implementing advanced analytics tools, accelerating '

 'text': 'SUNNYVALE, Calif. ,\xa0Dec. 2, 2020 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'today announced the U.S. Space Force has determined the fifth Space '
         'Based Infrared System Geosynchronous Earth Orbit satellite ( SBIRS '
         'GEO-5 ) is complete and ready for launch in 2021. Built in a record '
         'time and at no additional cost to the government for the upgrade, '
         'SBIRS GEO-5 is the first military space satellite built on the '
         'company’s modernized, modular LM 2100™ combat bus.\xa0SBIRS GEO-6, '
         'launching in 2022, is also being built on the new bus designed for '
         'speed and resilience. “SBIRS’ role as an ever-present, on-orbit '
         'guardian against global ballistic missile threats has never been '
         'more critical,” said Tom McCormick, Lockheed Martin’s vice president '
         'for Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) Systems. “In 2019 alone, '
         'SBIRS detected nearly one thousand missile launches, which is about '
         'a two-fold increase in two years.” “Completing the production of a '
         'complex missile-warning satellite during the challenging COVID '
         'environment is a huge accomplishment and is a testament to Lockheed '
         'Martin’s professionalism and dedication to the security of our '
         'Nation,” said Capt. Alec Cook, Space and Missile Systems Center’s '
         'SBIRS GEO-5/6 Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations lead. Both SBIRS '
         'GEO-5 and GEO-6 are slated to join the U.S. Space Force’s '
         'constellation of missile warning\xa0satellites,\xa0equipped with '
         'powerful scanning and staring infrared surveillance sensors, which '
         'protect our nation 24-7. These sensors collect data that allow the '
         'U.S. military to detect missile launches, support ballistic missile '
         'defense, expand technical intelligence gathering and bolster '
         'situational awareness on the battlefield. SBIRS GEO-5 was officially '
         'completed on Oct. 29, 2020. LM 2100 Bus: Focuses on Speed and '
         'Resiliency The LM 2100 bus is the result of a Lockheed Martin '
         'internally-funded, multi-year modernization initiative. It is '
         'designed to provide greater resiliency and cyber-hardening; enhanced '
         'spacecraft power, propulsion and electronics; common components and '
         'procedures to streamline manufacturing; and a flexible design that '
         'reduces the cost to incorporate future, modernized sensor suites. '
         '“We added even further enhanced resiliency features to the LM 2100 '
         'to create an initial ‘combat bus’ for the Space Force.\xa0SBIRS '
         'GEO-5 has proven itself a valuable incremental step towards '
         'achieving the resilient missile warning that will be provided by the '
         'Next Gen OPIR Block 0 System, the follow-on to SBIRS,” added '
         'McCormick. In June 2015, the Air Force agreed to rebaseline SBIRS '
         'GEO-5 and GEO-6 to upgrade both satellites to Lockheed Martin’s '
         'modernized LM 2100 bus at no additional cost. From that point, SBIRS '
         'GEO-5 was completed in approximately five years, in line with the '
         'government’s need to increase production speed and address emerging '
         'threats, and still supporting the government’s original 2021 launch '
         'date. Besides SBIRS GEO-5 and GEO-6, the LM 2100 space vehicle is '
         'the baseline for three Next Gen OPIR Block 0 GEO satellites '
         'expecting to launch starting in 2025; and the future GPS III Follow '
         'On (GPS IIIF) satellites, which are expected to launch starting in '
         '2026. Lockheed Martin is proud to be part of the SBIRS team led by '
         'the Production Corps, Geosynchronous Earth Orbit Division, at the '

         'supported by the U.S. Navy, Missile Defense Agency and Lockheed '
         'Martin (NYSE: LMT), successfully conducted a remote engagement '
         '(lethal intercept) of an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) '
         'target. The Flight Test Maritime (FTM) – 44 test marks the first '
         'demonstration of an Aegis Baseline engagement of an '
         'ICBM-representative target. This vital test demonstrated the latest '
         'Aegis Baseline 9.C2.0 capability against an ICBM class threat and '
         'introduces the ability to provide layered Homeland Defense with '
         'Aegis . The target was launched from the Reagan Test Site (RTS) to '
         'conduct an Aegis Engage on Remote (EOR) mission.\xa0 As designed in '
         'the current U.S. command and control architecture, the remote target '
         'track and discrimination data was provided by the MDA’s Command, '
         'Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system and '
         'forwarded to Aegis for prosecution. “This successful intercept is a '
         'tremendous accomplishment and confirms we have inherent capability '
         'against long range ballistic missile threats that can be deployed to '
         'all our Aegis Baseline 9 ships and Aegis Ashore sites – at any '
         'moment.\xa0 The success of this mission has significant underpinning '
         'to the Aegis system’s strategic ability to provide Layered Homeland '
         'Defense,” said Jim Sheridan, vice president and general manager at '
         'Lockheed Martin. With the successful completion of four Aegis '
         'Baseline 9.C2.0 European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) Phase 3 '
         'intercepts of Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM), this test '
         'demonstrated the ability to provide a globally deployed defensive '
         'weapon system. This missile defense system will defend the United '
         'States, its friends and allies from hostile ballistic missiles from '
         'all regions, all ranges, and during all phases of flight by a single '
         'integrated system that is capable of comprehensive layered '
         'defense.\xa0 As C2BMC capability continues to advance, it will help '
         'to unlock even more Aegis weapon system capability and lethality. '
         'Working as the Aegis Combat System Engineering Agent (CSEA), '
         'Lockheed Martin engineers updated the Aegis weapon system to '
         'integrate the SM-3 IIA weapon and adapted the system to target, '
         'identify, and intercept the ICBM threat. “We have evolved Aegis to '
         'perform a mission for which it wasn’t originally designed. The '
         'flexibility and adaptability of the total system – as well as our '
         'industry and government engineering teams -- allows Aegis to answer '
         'the call when needed,” Sheridan added. Engineered to meet any '
         'ballistic missile defense need, the Aegis Weapon System is built on '
         '50 years of constant evolution and innovation. Its flexible '
         'architecture enables it to fulfill a variety of missions – which is '
         'why it’s one of the most deployed combat system in the world. Aegis '
         'Baseline 9.C2.0 is built from the Common Source Library (CSL) and '

 'text': 'STRATFORD, Conn. , Oct. 28, 2020 / PRNewswire / --\xa0Sikorsky, a '
         'Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: LMT) will build six additional '
         'production CH-53K King Stallion helicopters under a new contract for '
         'the U.S. Navy. The aircraft will further support the U.S. Marine '
         'Corps in its mission to conduct expeditionary heavy-lift assault '
         'transport of armored vehicles, equipment and personnel to support '
         'distributed operations deep inland from a sea-based center of '
         'operations.     The six helicopters are part of 200 aircraft Program '
         'of Record for the U.S. Marine Corps, and their addition makes a '
         'total of 24 CH-53K production aircraft now under contract. Under the '
         'terms of this most recent contract – known as\xa0Low Rate Initial '
         'Production (LRIP) Lot 4 – Sikorsky will begin deliveries of the six '
         'aircraft in January 2024 . "This contract award is a testament to '
         "the government's confidence in the CH-53K platform. This award shows "
         'that we are working hard to make the aircraft more affordable," said '
         'Major General Greg Masiello , program executive office, air ASW, '
         'assault and special mission programs. "The capability and '
         'affordability of the CH-53K is important to ensure that we provide a '
         'valuable addition to the United States Marine Corps and our friends '
         'and allies." King Stallion Production Marches Ahead The CH-53K '
         'program has five aircraft on the line at Sikorsky facilities in '
         'Connecticut and over\xa0 two dozen in various stages of production. '
         'The program will deliver the first low rate initial production '
         'aircraft in September 2021 . Sikorsky and its suppliers have made '
         'significant investments in facilities, machinery, tooling, and '
         'workforce training to ramp up production required for the CH-53K '
         'program. For example, for the first time, newly installed 10-ton '
         'cranes lifted a 12,000 lb. gearbox into a CH-53K production '
         'aircraft. "The production of this CH-53K helicopter represents a new '
         'era in capabilities, technologies, safety and mission flexibility '
         'for the U.S. Marine Corps. Sikorsky is committed to supporting the '
         'Marine Corps to maximize the benefits of this all new helicopter," '
         'said Bill Falk , Sikorsky CH-53K program director. "Pilots are '
         'already training on state-of-the art flight training devices to '
         'prepare in a safe, cost-effective manner for operational '
         'deployment," Falk said. CH-53K Proving Capabilities The CH-53K is '
         'also nearing the conclusion of the developmental flight test events '
         'in preparation for Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E), '
         "having flown more than 2,000 flight hours validating the aircraft's "
         'performance on a ship and in both hot and cold environments. This '

 'text': 'ORLANDO, Fla., Dec. 2, 2020 – U.S. Marines are now preparing to fly, '
         'maintain and sustain the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, which will '
         'enable them to safely complete longer-range missions in harsher '
         'environments compared to the current fleet of aircraft. The suite of '
         'training devices from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) were recently '
         'declared Ready for Training at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New '
         'River in Jacksonville, North Carolina. “These training devices will '
         'prepare aircrew and maintainers for the full suite of capabilities '
         'of the CH-53K in a safe and cost-effective manner,” said Tom Gordon, '
         'Lockheed Martin, vice president of Training and Simulation '
         'Solutions. “Crews can rehearse for operational deployment, ensuring '
         'the U.S. Marines are ready to successfully complete their missions.” '
         'The Containerized Flight Training Device (CFTD) is a portable '
         'full-mission flight simulator that will allow flight crews to train '
         'on the full scope of Marine Corps heavy lift missions, including '
         'external lift operations. The CFTD replicates the functionality, '
         'flight characteristics, mission profiles and unmatched capabilities '
         'of the CH-53K helicopter. The device can replicate the various '
         'environmental conditions that the aircraft is likely to fly in as '
         'well as a multitude of mission profiles in the operation of a true '
         'heavy lift helicopter. The Helicopter Emulation Maintenance Trainer '
         '(HEMT) and Composite Maintenance Trainer (CMT) are both '
         'purpose-built for the King Stallion’s maintenance training. The HEMT '
         'is a computer-based lab that familiarizes the mechanic with '
         'maintenance tasks they perform, including tools, functions and '
         'checks. By virtually depicting the inside and outside of the '
         'aircraft and providing feedback, maintainers can learn many of the '
         'maintenance functions utilizing the HEMT prior to working on the '
         'aircraft. The CMT is a full-scale mock-up of the aircraft and is the '
         'final step of familiarizing the maintainer with the aircraft. The '
         'device allows students to interact with the physical controls of the '
         'aircraft to learn to remove and install hardware and perform '
         'functional checks. An instructor operating system assigns tasks and '
         'monitors progress for focused feedback. “The training devices will '
         'ensure a flawless entry into service for the CH-53K heavy lift '
         'helicopter,” said Bill Falk, Sikorsky CH-53K program director. “We '
         'are proud to build this 21 st century helicopter giving mission '
         'flexibility to the U.S. Marine Corps.” King Stallion Production '
         'Marches On The CH-53K program has five aircraft on the final '
         'assembly line in Connecticut and over two dozen in various stages of '
         'production. In October, the U.S. Navy awarded Sikorsky a contract to '
         'build six more heavy lift helicopters. The program will deliver the '
         'first low rate initial production aircraft in September 2021. CH-53K '
         'Proving Capabilities The CH-53K is also nearing the conclusion of '
         'the developmental flight test events to support Initial Operational '
         'Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) in 2021 and first deployment in 2023-2024. '
         'The CH-53K has flown more than 2,100 flight hours validating the '
         'aircraft’s performance, including testing on a ship and in both hot '
         'and cold environments. This year, the aircraft completed air-to-air '
         'refueling with a 27,000-lb. external load demonstrating its ability '
         'to enable heavy-lift transport from sea to shore. The CH-53K, which '
         'can lift 36,000 pounds , is the most powerful heavy lift helicopter '
         'ever built in the United States. The King Stallion’s technologically '
         'advanced design will meet the future warfighting requirements for '
         'decades to come, enabling missions like humanitarian aid, troop and '

         'operating profit is a non-GAAP measure. See the "Non-GAAP Financial '
         'Measures" section of this news release for more information. 3 In '
         'the first nine months of 2020, the corporation recognized a non-cash '
         'impairment charge of $128 million ($96 million, or $0.34 per share, '
         'after tax) for its investment in the international equity method '

         'million, or $0.13 per share, after tax) related to properties sold '
         'in 2015 as a result of completing its remaining obligations. 5 '
         'Discontinued operations for the third quarter and first nine months '
         'of 2020 include a $55 million ($0.20 per share) non-cash charge '
         'resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the '
         'former Information Systems & Global Solutions business divested in '
         '2016. 6 Net earnings for the third quarter and the first nine months '
         'of 2019 included a benefit of approximately $62 million ($0.22 per '

         'discrete recording of additional tax deductions related to 2018, '

         "Government's increase in the progress payment rate from 80 percent "
         'to 90 percent and the deferral of $155 million for the employer '
         'portion of payroll taxes to 2021 and 2022 pursuant to the CARES Act. '
         'These were offset by $400 million of federal estimated income tax '
         'payments deferred from the second quarter of 2020 pursuant to IRS '
         'guidance, in addition to the third quarter 2020 tax payment of $410 '
         'million.\xa0Additionally, the corporation used the accelerated '

         'related to COVID-19, however, the ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on '
         "the corporation's financial outlook for 2020 and beyond remains "
         'uncertain. 2 The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment is presented as a '
         'single amount and includes total expected U.S. Government cost '
         'accounting standards (CAS) pension cost of approximately $1,975 '
         'million and total expected financial accounting standards (FAS) '
         'pension income of approximately $115 million. CAS pension cost and '
         'the service cost component of FAS pension expense are included in '
         'operating profit. The non-service cost components of FAS pension '
         'expense are included in non-operating income (expense). For '
         "additional detail on the corporation's FAS/CAS pension adjustment, "
         'see the supplemental table included at the end of this news release. '
         '2021 Financial Trends The corporation expects its 2021 net sales to '
         'increase to greater than or equal to $67 billion . Total business '
         'segment operating margin in 2021 is expected to be in the 10.9 '
         'percent to 11.1 percent range and cash from operations is expected '
         'to be greater than or equal to $8.1 billion , net of $1.0 billion of '
         'planned pension contributions. The preliminary outlook for 2021 '
         'assumes continued support and funding of our programs, including '
         'recovery of COVID-19 cost impacts, and a statutory tax rate of 21%. '
         'Additionally, the preliminary outlook for 2021 assumes that there '
         'will not be significant reductions in customer budgets, changes in '
         'funding priorities and that the U.S. Government will not continue to '
         'operate under a continuing resolution for an extended period in '
         'which new contract and program starts are restricted. Changes in '
         'circumstances may require the corporation to revise its assumptions, '
         'which could materially change its current estimate of 2021 net '
         'sales, operating margin and cash flows. The corporation currently '
         'expects a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of approximately $2.1 '
         'billion in 2021. This estimate assumes a 2.50 percent discount rate '
         '(a 75 basis point decrease from the end of 2019), a 7.00 percent '
         'return on plan assets in 2020, and a 7.00 percent expected long-term '
         'rate of return on plan assets in future years, among other '
         'assumptions. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points to the '
         'assumed discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, '
         'would result in an incremental increase or decrease of approximately '
         '$15 million to the estimated net 2021 FAS/CAS pension benefit. A '
         'change of plus or minus 100 basis points to the return on plan '
         'assets in 2020 only, with all other assumptions held constant, would '
         'result in an incremental increase or decrease of approximately $15 '
         'million to the estimated net 2021 FAS/CAS pension benefit. The '
         'corporation expects to make contributions of approximately $1.0 '
         'billion to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021 and '
         'anticipates recovering approximately $2.1 billion of CAS pension '
         'cost. The corporation will complete the annual remeasurement of its '
         'postretirement benefit plans and update its estimated 2021 FAS/CAS '
         'pension adjustment on Dec. 31, 2020 . The final assumptions and '
         'actual investment return for 2020 may differ materially from those '
         'discussed above. COVID-19 The global outbreak of the coronavirus '
         'disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health '
         'Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government in '
         'March 2020 and has negatively affected the U.S. and global '
         'economies, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant '
         'travel and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and '
         'orders to "shelter-in-place" and quarantine restrictions, and '
         'created significant disruption of the financial markets. Lockheed '
         'Martin has taken measures to protect the health and safety of its '
         'employees, work with its customers and suppliers to minimize '
         'disruptions and support its community in addressing the challenges '
         'posed by this ongoing global pandemic. The pandemic has presented '
         'unprecedented business challenges, and the corporation has '
         'experienced impacts in each business area related to COVID-19, '
         'primarily in increased coronavirus-related costs, delays in supplier '
         'deliveries, impacts of travel restrictions, site access and '
         'quarantine requirements, and the impacts of remote work and adjusted '
         'work schedules. Despite these challenges, the corporation and the '
         "U.S. Government's pro-active efforts, especially with regard to the "
         'supply chain, helped to partially mitigate the disruptions caused by '
         "COVID-19 on the corporation's operations in the first nine months of "
         '2020. In addition, favorable contract award timing, strong '
         'operational performance and lower travel and overhead expenditures '
         'due to COVID-19 restrictions partially offset the impacts of '
         "COVID-19 on the corporation's financial results in the first nine "
         'months of 2020. However, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 in future '
         "periods remains uncertain. The corporation's 2020 outlook and 2021 "
         'financial trends assumes, among other things, that its production '
         'facilities continue to operate and it does not experience '
         'significant work stoppages or closures, it is able to mitigate any '
         'supply chain disruptions and these do not worsen, and it is able to '
         'recover its costs under U.S. Government contracts and government '
         "funding priorities do not change. While these are the corporation's "
         'current assumptions, they could change and will depend on future '
         'pandemic related developments, including the duration of the '
         'pandemic and any potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection '
         "and government actions. Cash Activities The corporation's cash "
         'activities in the third quarter of 2020 included the following: As '
         'previously reported on Sept. 25, 2020 , the corporation increased '
         'its quarterly dividend by $0.20 per share, to $2.60 per share, '
         'beginning with the dividend payment in the fourth quarter of 2020. '
         'The corporation also increased its share repurchase authority by '
         '$1.3 billion with $3.0 billion in total remaining authorization for '
         'future repurchases of common stock under the program as of Sept. 27, '
         '2020 . Segment Results The corporation operates in four business '
         'segments organized based on the nature of products and services '
         'offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and '
         'Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. The following table presents '

         'business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and '
         'profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. '
         "Operating profit of the corporation's business segments includes the "
         "corporation's share of earnings or losses from equity method "
         'investees as the operating activities of the investees are closely '
         'aligned with the operations of its business segments. Operating '
         "profit of the corporation's business segments also excludes the "
         'FAS/CAS operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate '
         'costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the '
         'U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting '
         'standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other '
         "items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment "
         'operating performance such as a portion of management and '
         'administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental '
         'costs, stock-based compensation expense, retiree benefits, '
         'significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains '
         'or losses from significant divestitures, and other miscellaneous '
         'corporate activities. The corporation recovers CAS pension cost '
         'through the pricing of its products and services on U.S. Government '
         'contracts and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension cost in each of its '
         "business segments' net sales and cost of sales. The corporation's "
         'consolidated financial statements must present pension and other '
         'postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with '
         'U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as FAS '
         'expense). The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension '
         'adjustment represents the difference between the service cost '
         'component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost. The '
         'non-service FAS pension expense components are included in other '
         'non-operating expense. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases '
         'or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense '
         '(both service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating '
         'profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume '
         'refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit '
         'resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or '
         'service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment '
         'operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking '
         'rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of the '
         "corporation's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin "
         'may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit '
         "booking rates on the corporation's contracts for which it recognizes "
         'revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost '
         'method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in profit '
         'booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually '
         'relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the '
         'performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a '
         'particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract '
         'may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total '
         'costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the '
         'profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates '
         'are recognized in the current period and reflect the '
         'inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit '
         'and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other '
         'items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may '
         'include the positive resolution of contractual matters, insurance '
         'recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may '
         'include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring '

         "increased and realized upon the assets' disposition. The rates for "
         'both periods benefited from additional tax deductions based on '
         'proposed tax regulations released on March 4, 2019 , which clarified '

 'text': 'DENVER , Oct. 20, 2020 / PRNewswire / -- In the dark and cold of '
         'deep space today, the Lockheed Martin-built OSIRIS-REx spacecraft '
         'descended to the surface of an asteroid and touched it with its '
         'robotic arm to collect a sample of its rocky material. Although '
         'brief, the Touch-And-Go, or TAG, event was years in the making.     '
         'A planetary remnant, asteroid Bennu, is about as tall as the Empire '
         'State Building and contains pristine material from the formation of '
         'the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago potentially including '
         'the organic molecular precursors to life on Earth. The Touch-And-Go '
         "Sample Acquisition Mechanism ( TAGSAM) on NASA's OSIRIS-REx "
         'spacecraft successfully touched the asteroid surface and fired one '
         'of its nitrogen gas canisters to agitate and collect the surface '
         'material through a filter in the round sampler head. Then seconds '
         'later, the spacecraft slowly backed away from the asteroid and is '
         'continuing to drift away until the sample is assessed. "Our nation '
         'has explored the solar system and landed on multiple bodies, but '
         'this is the first time we have attempted to collect a sample of an '
         'asteroid. Even though Bennu has posed many challenges, the team made '
         'it look easy today," said Lisa Callahan , vice president and general '
         'manager of Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed Martin. "Although '
         "there's more to do before we are fully successful, the TAG event "
         'went just as planned and I couldn\'t be prouder of the team." Using '
         'multiple techniques, the team will now take a few days to determine '
         "how much material, if any at all, was collected. The mission's goal "
         'is to harvest at least 60 grams—about the size of a candy bar—of '
         'regolith and potentially collect up to 2 kilograms. Mission '
         "operations of the spacecraft, including today's TAG collection "
         "event, were performed at Lockheed Martin Space's facility near "
         'Denver . The flight team has been operating the spacecraft since '
         'launch in September 2016 and operation around Bennu in December 2018 '
         ". Today's TAG maneuver is the first time NASA has attempted to "
         "collect material from an asteroid. OSIRIS-REx is NASA's third "
         'robotic sample return mission and Lockheed Martin has built and '
         'operated all three of those spacecraft. If the proper amount of '
         'material was collected, the team will stow the TAGSAM head, with '
         'material inside, into a sample return capsule. The spacecraft will '
         'then depart Bennu in March 2021 and return the capsule and sample to '

         'Hercules aircrews and maintainers will train in a facility located '
         'in France, built and equipped by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) for the '
         'countries’ binational C-130J Super Hercules Squadron. Lockheed '
         'Martin will provide training devices, the learning management '

         'under the terms of a new direct commercial sale (DCS) contract, '
         'allowing for in-country learning. Lockheed Martin will break ground '
         'on the training center in 2021 and aircrew and maintainers will '
         'begin training in the center in 2024. The training center will be '
         'located in Évreux-Fauville Air Base in the Normandy region of France '
         'and will provide training for both C-130J-30 airlifter and KC-130J '
         'tanker aircraft under a first-of-its-kind partnership in the entire '
         'scope of 65 years of Hercules history where the countries share the '
         'aircraft, which are used for aerial refueling, air drop and cargo '
         'missions. “The French/German C-130J Binational Training Center will '
         'allow both countries to train pilots and maintainers on the full '
         'capability of these proven aircraft,” said Tom Gordon, Lockheed '
         'Martin, vice president of Training and Simulation Solutions. '
         '“Lockheed Martin is honored to support this historic partnership and '
         'proud to work directly with our customers in establishing a '
         'first-of-its kind resource that will benefit Super Hercules crew '
         'members for decades to come.” The French and German binational '
         'squadron consists of a combined 10 Super Hercules aircraft. In 2018, '
         'Germany announced the acquisition of six Super Hercules aircraft '
         '(three C-130J-30s and three KC-130J fleets) to be operated in '
         'partnership with France. France has received a total of four Super '
         'Hercules aircraft through a Foreign Military Sale with the U.S. '
         'government. France’s Super Hercules are operated in conjunction with '
         'its existing C-130H fleet. Lockheed Martin is the leading global '
         'provider of C-130J training and has experience creating “turn-key” '
         'training facilities for the aircraft. Lockheed Martin’s own Hercules '
         'Training Center (HTC) is located in Marietta, Georgia, adjacent to '
         'the Super Hercules production line. The HTC is a combined academic '
         'and simulator facility purpose-built for training efficiency on the '
         'C-130J fleet. The HTC trains C-130J crews as needed and will be used '
         'to train France and Germany’s initial instructor cadre of pilots and '
         'maintainers during the construction of the new facility. The C-130J '
         'Super Hercules is the current production model of the legendary '
         'C-130 Hercules mid-size tactical airlifter, offering superior '
         'performance and enhanced capabilities with the range and versatility '
         'for every theater of operations and evolving requirements. To date, '
         'the Super Hercules fleet counts 24 operators in 21 nations around '
         'the world and has surpassed 2 million flight hours. As the '
         'preeminent tactical aerial refueling tanker, the KC-130J is a '
         'battle-tested solution that takes full advantage of the tremendous '
         'technological and performance improvements inherent in the C-130J '
         'Super Hercules aircraft. A true force multiplier, the KC-130J '

         'Geschwaders beider Länder beauftragt worden. Der erste Spatenstich '
         'für das Ausbildungszentrum mit Standort am Luftwaffenstützpunkt '
         'Évreux-Fauville (Normandie, Frankreich) ist für 2021 geplant. Ab '
         '2024 soll der Ausbildungsbetrieb beginnen. Lockheed Martin wird im '
         'Rahmen dieses Auftrages die Bereitstellung von Ausbildungsgerät, '
         'einem Lernmanagementsystem, Kursmaterial sowie verschiedener '
         'Trainingsservices für fünf Jahre übernehmen. Die Einrichtung wird '
         'die Ausbildung sowohl an der Transportversion C-130J-30 als auch am '
         'Tankflugzeug KC-130J abdecken. In der rund 65-jährigen Geschichte '
         'der C-130 „Hercules“ stellt der gemeinsame Betrieb durch zwei '
         'Partnerländer im Einsatzspektrum des taktischen Lufttransports und '
         'der Luftbetankung eine bislang einmalige Partnerschaft dar. „Das '
         'deutsch-französische C-130J Trainingszentrum wird beiden Ländern die '
         'optimale Vorbereitung von Piloten und Wartungspersonal ermöglichen, '
         'um das Potential der bewährten Flugzeuge optimal nutzen zu können“, '
         'so Tom Gordon, Vice President Training and Simulation Solutions bei '
         'Lockheed Martin. „Wir sind stolz darauf, diese historische '
         'Partnerschaft zu unterstützen und eng mit unseren Kunden an der '
         'Schaffung von Ausbildungsressourcen zusammenzuarbeiten, von denen '
         'die Besatzungsmitglieder der „Super Hercules“ für die kommenden '
         'Jahrzehnte profitieren werden.“ Das deutsch-französische Geschwader '
         'soll aus insgesamt zehn Transportflugzeugen bestehen. Im Jahr 2018 '
         'kündigte Deutschland die Anschaffung von insgesamt sechs „Super '
         'Hercules“ Luftfahrzeugen an (je drei C-130J-30 und KC-130J) an, die '
         'in Partnerschaft mit Frankreich betrieben werden sollen. Frankreich '
         'hat über einen so genannten Foreign Military Sale (FMS) mit der '
         'US-Regierung bereits vier „Super Hercules“ Flugzeuge erhalten. Die '
         'C-130J „Super Hercules“ ist das aktuelle Produktionsmodell basierend '
         'auf dem legendären taktischen Lufttransportflugzeug C-130 Hercules '
         'und bietet überlegene Leistung und Fähigkeiten in Reichweite und '
         'Vielseitigkeit für nahezu jedes Einsatzgebiet- und Szenario. Mit der '
         'KC-130J wird Deutschland ein erprobtes taktisches Tankflugzeug \xa0'
         'erhalten, dass für die schnelle Luft- und Bodenbetankung von '
         'Flugzeugen und Drehflüglern geeignet ist. Bis heute zählt die '

         'ganzen Welt und hat bereits mehr als 2 Millionen Flugstunden '

 'text': 'Stratford (CT), USA., 28. Oktober 2020 – Sikorsky, ein Unternehmen '
         'von Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), wird im Rahmen eines kürzlich '
         'geschlossenen Vertrags sechs weitere Transporthubschrauber des Typs '
         'CH-53K King Stallion produzieren. Die Luftfahrzeuge werden das U.S. '
         'Marine Corps (USMC) zusätzlich zur bestehenden Flotte bei seinem '
         'Auftrag unterstützen, taktische Lufttransporte von gepanzerten '
         'Fahrzeugen, Ausrüstung und Personal im Rahmen von Einsätzen tief im '
         'Landesinneren oder auf See bzw. in küstennahen Regionen '
         'durchzuführen. Mit diesem Baulos erhöht sich der Produktionauftrag '
         'auf 24 CH-53K im Rahmen des 200 Luftfahzeuge umfassenden Programms '
         '(„Program of Record“ -PoR). Auf Basis des Vertrags wird Sikorsky im '
         'Dezember 2023 mit der Auslieferung der sechs weiteren Hubschrauber '
         'beginnen. „Dieser Auftrag ist ein Vertrauensbeweis der Regierung in '
         'die Plattform CH-53K. Der Zuschlag zeigt, dass wir hart daran '
         'arbeiten, das Luftfahrzeug immer kosteneffizienter zu machen“, sagte '
         'Generalmajor Greg Masiello, verantwortlicher Program-Chef, Assault '
         'and Special Mission Programmes beim USMC. „Die Fähigkeiten bei '
         'gleichzeitiger Erschwinglichkeit der CH-53K sind entscheidend, um '
         'dem U.S. Marine Corps sowie unseren Freunden und Verbündeten eine '
         'echte Verstärkung anbieten zu können.“ Produktion des „King '
         'Stallion“ mit großen Fortschritten Aktuell sind im Rahmen des '
         'CH-53K-Programms fünf Luftfahrzeuge direkt in der Fertigungslinie '
         'des Sikorsky Werks in Stratford, Connecticut, einige Dutzend '
         'befinden sich zudem in verschiedenen Produktionsstadien. Das '
         'Programm sieht die Auslieferung der ersten Hubschrauber aus dieser '
         'Produktionsphase im September 2021 (LRIP - Low Rate Initial '
         'Production) vor. Sikorsky und seine Zulieferer haben erhebliche '
         'Investitionen in Anlagen, Maschinen, Werkzeuge und die Ausbildung '
         'der Mitarbeiter getätigt, um die für das CH-53K-Programm '
         'erforderliche Produktion hochzufahren. So kommen bespielsweise '
         'bereits die neu installierten 10 Tonnen Hallen-Kräne zum Einsatz, '
         'die problemlos dazu in der Lage sind, die über fünf Tonnen schweren '
         'Getriebe-Rotorkopf-Einheiten in den Luftfahrzeugen zu platzieren. '
         '„Die Produktion der CH-53K Transporthubschrauber leitet eine neue '
         'Ära an Fähigkeiten, Technologie, Sicherheit und Einsatzflexibilität '
         'für das U.S. Marine Corps ein. Sikorsky setzt alles daran, das USMC '
         'dabei zu unterstützen, das größtmögliche Potential dieser komplett '
         'neuen Hubschrauberflotte zu nutzen“, so Bill Falk, '
         'CH-53K-Programmdirektor von Sikorsky. „Die Luftfahrzeugbesatzungen '
         'trainieren jetzt schon an hochmodernen Simulatoren, um sich auf '
         'sichere und kostengünstige Weise auf den operativen Einsatz '
         'vorzubereiten“, so Falk weiter. CH-53K stellt Fähigkeiten in '
         'herausforderndem Testprogramm unter Beweis Der schwere '
         'Transporthubschrauber CH-53K nähert sich zudem dem Abschluss der '
         'Erprobungsphase als Vorbereitung für die Einsatzprüfung (Initial '
         'Operational Test & Evaluation - IOT&E). Zu diesem Zweck hat die '
         'CH-53K bereits mehr als 2.000 Flugstunden absolviert – unter äußerst '
         'anspruchsvollen Bedingungen auf See sowie in klimatisch sehr heißen '
         'und kalten Umgebungen. In 2020 allein wurden dabei folgende Tests '

 'text': 'ORLANDO , Fla., Oct. 28, 2020 – The U.S. Air Force Strategic '
         'Development Planning and Experimentation (SDPE) Office awarded '
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) a $25 million contract to support the '
         'next phase of the service’s Palletized Munitions Experimentation '
         'Campaign. The fourth phase includes a system-level demonstration in '
         '2021 and continues to assess the potential to deliver large volumes '
         'of air-launched weapons via airlifters. "Despite the Palletized '
         'Munitions program being relatively new, it’s moving very quickly,” '
         'said Scott Callaway, Lockheed Martin Advanced Strike Systems '
         'director. “The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) contracting '
         'and Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation (SDPE) '
         'offices, and Lockheed Martin teams established this new contract in '
         'a record time of 30 days, supporting faster prototyping and a '
         'shorter timeline to bring this advanced capability to the warfighter '
         'in the field." Initial studies show that airlifters have the '
         'potential to deploy large quantities of Joint Air-to-Surface '
         'Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) missiles, providing a '
         'significant increase in long-range standoff scale and complementing '
         'traditional strike and bomber aircrafts. This innovative approach '
         'enables warfighters to launch offensive operations from a greater '
         'number of airfields and engage a larger number of near-peer '
         'adversarial targets. The overall goal of the experimentation is to '
         'develop a modular system to deliver air-launched weapons, leveraging '
         'standard airdrop procedures and operations. The system will have the '
         'ability to be rolled on and off multiple types of aircraft, '
         'including the C-17 and C-130. Phase I successfully accomplished five '
         'high-altitude airdrops from an MC-130J (manufactured by Lockheed '
         'Martin) and a C-17 earlier this year using simulated weapons. During '
         'this effort, the U.S. Air Force tested the suitability of launching '
         'JASSM-ERs from an airlifter. JASSM is a long-range, conventional, '
         'air-to-ground, precision standoff missile for the U.S. and allied '
         'forces designed to destroy high-value, well-defended, fixed and '

 'text': 'DENVER , Sept. 10, 2020 / PRNewswire / --\xa0The University of '
         'Colorado Boulder and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)\xa0will soon lead a '
         'new space mission to capture the first-ever closeup look at a '
         'mysterious class of solar system objects: binary asteroids.     '
         'These bodies are pairs of asteroids that orbit around each other in '
         'space, much like the Earth and Moon. In a project review on Sept. 3 '
         ', NASA gave the official go-ahead to the Janus mission, named after '
         'the two-faced Roman god. The mission will study these asteroid '
         'couplets in never-before-seen detail. Known as Key Decision Point-C '
         '(KDP-C), this review and approval from NASA allows for the project '
         "to begin implementation, and baselines +the project's official "
         'schedule and budget. It will be a moment for twos: In 2022, the '
         'Janus team will launch two identical spacecraft that will travel '
         'millions of miles to individually fly close to two pairs of binary '
         'asteroids. Their observations could open up a new window into how '
         'these diverse bodies evolve and even burst apart over time, said '
         'Daniel Scheeres , the principle investigator for Janus. "Binary '
         "asteroids are one class of objects for which we don't have "
         'high-resolution scientific data," said Scheeres, distinguished '
         'professor in the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace '
         'Engineering Sciences at CU Boulder. "Everything we have on them is '
         "based on ground observations, which don't give you as much detail as "
         'being up close." The mission, which will cost less than $55 million '
         "under NASA's SIMPLEx program , may also help to usher in a new era "
         "of space exploration, said Lockheed Martin's Janus Project Manager "
         "Josh Wood . He explained that Janus' twin spacecraft are designed to "
         'be small and nimble, each one about the size of a carry-on suitcase. '
         '"We see an advantage to be able to shrink our spacecraft," said '
         'Wood. "With technology advancements, we can now explore our solar '
         'system and address important science questions with smaller '
         'spacecraft." Janus is led by the University of Colorado Boulder , '
         'where Scheeres is based, which will also undertake the scientific '
         'analysis of images and data for the mission. Lockheed Martin will '
         'manage, build and operate the spacecraft. The mission will '
         'rendezvous with two binary pairs—named 1996 FG3 and 1991 VH—each '
         'showcasing a different kind of orbital pattern. The pair called 1991 '
         'VH, for example, has a "moon" that whips around a much bigger '
         '"primary" asteroid following a hard-to-predict pattern. The team '
         'will use a suite of cameras to track the dynamical motion in '
         'unprecedented detail. Among other goals, Scheeres and his colleagues '
         'hope to learn more about how binary asteroids move—both around each '
         'other and through space. "Once we see them up close up, there will '
         'be a lot of questions we can answer, but these will raise new '
         'questions as well," Scheeres said. "We think Janus will motivate '
         'additional missions to binary asteroids." Wood added that the '
         "mission's twin spacecraft, each of which weigh just about 80 pounds, "
         'will travel farther than any small satellite to date. After blasting '
         "off in 2022, they'll first complete an orbit around the sun, before "
         'heading back toward Earth and sling-shotting their way far into '
         'space and beyond the orbit of Mars. "I think it\'s a great test for '
         'what is achievable from the aerospace community," Wood said. "And '
         'the Colorado -centric development for this mission, combining the '
         'space talent of both CU Boulder and Lockheed Martin, is a testament '
         'to the skills available in the state." About Lockheed Martin '

         'features were demonstrated, including aviation support, small boat '
         'launch handling and recovery and machinery control and automation. '
         'Now that trials are complete, the ship will undergo final outfitting '
         'and fine-tuning before delivery to the U.S. Navy. LCS 21 is the '
         'eleventh Freedom-variant LCS designed and built by the Lockheed '

         "acceptance trials, we successfully tested the ship's "
         'maneuverability, automation and core combat capability." The '
         'Freedom-variant LCS has completed four successful deployments, '

         'LCS 7 deployed to the U.S. Southern Command supporting the Martillo '
         'campaign – a multinational effort targeting illicit trafficking '

         'capabilities, U.S. Southern Commander Admiral Craig Faller  recently '
         'stated , "LCS has proven to be an effective and adaptable platform '
         'capable of multiple missions in our area of responsibility. It has '
         'become an end-game enabler for U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement '
         'authorities who disrupt transnational criminal organizations and the '
         'smuggling of deadly narcotics. Adding the LCS to our Enhanced '

         'control (C2) pathfinder for the follow-on Next Generation Overhead '
         'Persistent Infrared (OPIR) satellites. Lockheed Martin has worked in '
         'tandem with the U.S. military as its lead missile warning mission '
         'integrator for the past 20 years. The company has designed and '
         'launched four SBIRS GEO missile warning satellites; is modernizing '
         'the design of the SBIRS GEO 5/6 spacecrafts to provide more '
         'resiliency and efficiency; is developing Block 0 of the Next '
         'Generation OPIR GEO missile warning satellites, and has served as '
         'lead sustainment and operations contractor. “We understand the OPIR '
         'mission end-to-end because we developed, launched, and sustain it, '
         'both in space and on the ground,” said Maria Demaree, vice president '
         'and general manager, Lockheed Martin Space Mission Solutions. “We '
         'also understand that our nation’s adversaries would also seek to '
         'defeat our defensive systems and are committed to developing '
         'advanced technology that always keeps us ahead of the threat.” GNOME '
         'will be rapidly developed and integrated using Agile software '
         'methodologies , which have a proven track record over a decade for '
         'many Lockheed Martin Space customers. Agile lets us deliver '
         'iterative features and fix bugs as we go. It dramatically improves '
         'the software engineering quality and delivery timelines while '
         'avoiding cost overruns that previous software delivery models '
         'sometimes face. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the '
         'Space Force’s Next Gen OPIR Block 0 GEO satellites, which will '
         'provide improved missile warning capabilities that are more '
         'survivable and resilient against emerging threats. The U.S. '
         'Department of the Air Force implemented Next Gen OPIR as a rapid '
         'acquisition program in 2018. Lockheed Martin recently completed '
         'successful preliminary design reviews for two potential advanced '
         'sensor payload providers for the new system as well as successfully '

 'text': 'DENVER , July 29, 2020 / PRNewswire / --\xa0Lockheed Martin (NYSE: '
         'LMT) developed the technology behind the aeroshell that will protect '
         "NASA's newest Mars rover, Perseverance, and deploy the first-ever "
         'Mars helicopter. The Mars 2020 spacecraft with its Perseverance '
         'rover is scheduled to launch July 30 from Space Launch Complex-41 at '
         'Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V '
         "rocket.     The Perseverance rover , built by NASA's Jet Propulsion "
         'Laboratory (JPL), will study the geology of Mars while searching for '
         'signs of past microbial life, collects samples of rock, and will '
         'even set the stage for human exploration to the planet. The '
         '2,260-pound rover is enclosed in an aeroshell capsule that protects '
         'the rover during its seven-month deep space flight and atmospheric '
         'descent toward the Martian surface. Lockheed Martin built this large '
         'aeroshell and every previous NASA aeroshell sent to the Red Planet. '
         'The mission also debuts the first helicopter designed for another '
         'planet, named Ingenuity, to test autonomous flight on Mars. Lockheed '
         'Martin was tasked by JPL to build the Mars helicopter delivery '
         'system ( MHDS ) that will deploy the helicopter to the Martian '
         'surface for its flight. The delivery system was designed by Lockheed '
         'Martin collaboratively with JPL and attaches the Ingenuity '
         'helicopter to the belly of the rover. The lightweight system was '
         'designed to reliably deploy the 4-pound helicopter to the surface '
         'using four pyrotechnic separation events. It also protects Ingenuity '
         'from debris during landing with a durable, yet light, composite '
         'debris shield. "This mission is pivotal to the future of Mars '
         'exploration," said Lisa Callahan , vice president and general '
         'manager of Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed Martin Space. "Our '
         'partnership with NASA to build the aeroshell and engineer the Mars '
         'helicopter delivery system allowed us to draw upon our deep '
         'expertise in aeroshells while also inventing new systems to enable '
         'the first flight in the atmosphere of Mars. This all moves us closer '
         'to the day humankind will walk on the Red Planet." The Mars 2020 '
         'aeroshell, along with the one built for the Mars Science Laboratory '
         'mission, is the largest built for a robotic mission. Composed of a '
         'heat shield and cone-shaped back shell measuring 15 feet in '
         'diameter, the aeroshell is constructed in a composite aluminum '
         'honeycomb structure sandwiched by graphite-epoxy face sheets. The '
         'heat shield is covered with tiles of a protective material called '
         'phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA) that can withstand the '
         'more than 2,370 degrees Fahrenheit seen during peak heating. '

 'text': 'LITTLETON , Colo., Sept. 1, 2020 – The Space Development Agency '
         '(SDA) awarded a Tranche 0 contract of the Space Transport Layer to '
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) to demonstrate a mesh network of 10 '
         'small satellites that links terrestrial warfighting domains to space '
         'sensors – all launching in just two years. The $187.5-million '
         'contract for Transport Layer’s Tranche 0 is an initial test and '
         'demonstration phase, with two prime contractors building a total of '
         '20 satellites. The first step toward building an interoperable, '
         'connected secure mesh network, it will help enable Joint All-Domain '
         'Operations , allowing warfighters to stay ahead of emerging threats. '
         'By linking nodes together, seamless connectivity is created between '
         'all domains, much like today’s smartphones. “We see a world across '
         'all warfighting domains where fourth and fifth-generation fighters '
         'and tactical forces on the ground can connect seamlessly with '
         'holistic situational awareness,” said Kay Sears, vice president and '
         'general manager of Lockheed Martin Military Space. “Interoperability '
         'and battlespace connectivity are critical to staying ahead of our '
         'adversaries.” The 10 satellites, operating in Low Earth Orbit, will '
         'provide secure high-bandwidth, low-latency data links. Additionally, '
         'new Link 16 network connectivity will be introduced to space. This '
         'capability\xa0will connect to systems that include fighter aircraft '
         'like F-16, F-22, and F-35, missile defense networks like PAC-3 and '
         'THAAD, weapons systems, and Integrated Air and Missile Defense '
         '(IAMD) networks, and will provide sensor-to-shooter targeting and '
         'situational awareness for tactical land and maritime warfighters. '
         'Changing the Dynamics of Warfighting This beyond-line-of-site '
         'tracking, targeting and communications will dramatically extend U.S. '
         'warfighting options and allows additional coalition and allied '
         'partners to eventually bring their capabilities into the network. '
         'Interoperability extends into space with prospective data '
         'connections to commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) and '
         'other military protected satcom systems, which will require close '
         'partnership with multiple companies across industry. How Software '
         'Adds Flexibility to Missions Each Transport Layer satellite will be '
         'fully-software defined, using SmartSat™ , Lockheed Martin’s '
         'software-defined platform that makes it easier to dynamically add '
         'and quickly change missions in orbit through simple app uploads. The '
         'satellites will also be fully cyber-hardened from day one using '
         'Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Resiliency Level® model to identify cyber '
         'strengths and weaknesses so we can address those early in the design '
         'process. The Transport Layer contributes to resilience in space '
         'communications. Mission resilience comes from being able to form a '
         'seamless network of networks, with network nodes spanning multiple '
         'domains and services provided via multiple tactical data links, '
         'making it much harder for an adversary to disrupt because of network '

 'text': 'DENVER , June 30, 2020 / PRNewswire / --\xa0After a successful '
         'launch this afternoon, the third Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)-built '
         'GPS III satellite is now headed to orbit under its own propulsion. '
         'The satellite has separated from its rocket and is using onboard '
         'power to climb to its operational orbit, approximately 12,550 miles '
         'above the Earth.  GPS III Space Vehicle 03 ( GPS III SV03 ) is '
         'responding to commands from U.S. Space Force and Lockheed Martin '
         "engineers in the Launch & Checkout Center at the company's Denver "
         'facility. There, they declared rocket booster separation and '
         "satellite control about\xa090 minutes after the satellite's\xa04: 10 "
         'p.m. EST launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket\xa0from Cape '
         'Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida . "In the coming days, GPS III '
         "SV03's onboard liquid apogee engines will continue to propel the "
         'satellite towards its operational orbit," said Tonya Ladwig , '
         "Lockheed Martin's Acting Vice President for Navigation Systems. "
         '"Once it arrives, we\'ll send the satellite commands to deploy its '
         'solar arrays and antennas, and prepare the satellite for handover to '
         'Space Operations Command." After on-orbit testing, GPS III SV03 is '
         'expected to join the GPS constellation – including GPS III SV01 and '
         'SV02, which were declared operational in January and April – in '
         'providing positioning, navigation and timing signals for more than '
         'four billion military, civil and commercial users. Lockheed Martin '
         'designed GPS III to help the Space Force modernize the GPS '
         'constellation with new technology and capabilities. The new GPS IIIs '
         'provide three times better accuracy and up to eight times improved '
         'anti-jamming capabilities over any previous GPS satellite. They also '
         'offer a new L1C civil signal, which is compatible with other '
         "international global navigation satellite systems, like Europe's "
         'Galileo, to improve civilian user connectivity. GPS III also '
         "continues the Space Force's plan to field M-Code, a more-secure, "
         'harder-to-jam and spoof GPS signal for our military forces. GPS III '
         'SV03 brings the number of M-Code enabled satellites to 22 in the '
         '31-satellite GPS constellation. "As a nation, we use GPS signals '
         'every day -- they time-stamp all our financial transactions, they '
         'make aviation safe, they make precision farming possible, and so '
         'much more. GPS has become a critical part of our national '
         'infrastructure. In fact, the U.S. economic benefit of GPS is '
         'estimated to be over $300 billion per year and $1.4 trillion since '
         'its inception," added Ladwig. "Continued investment in modernizing '
         'GPS – updating technology, improving its capabilities – is well '
         'worth it." Lockheed Martin is proud to be a part of the GPS III team '
         'led by the Space Production Corps Medium Earth Orbit Division, at '
         "the Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air "
         'Force Base. The GPS Operational Control Segment sustainment is '
         'managed by the Enterprise Corps, GPS Sustainment Division at '
         'Peterson Air Force Base.\xa0The 2nd Space Operations Squadron, at '

         'Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government in '
         'March 2020 and has negatively affected the U.S. and global '
         'economies, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant '
         'travel and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and '
         'orders to "shelter-in-place" and quarantine restrictions, and '
         'created significant disruption of the financial markets. Lockheed '
         'Martin has taken measures to protect the health and safety of its '
         'employees, work with its customers and suppliers to minimize '
         'disruptions and support its community in addressing the challenges '
         'posed by this ongoing global pandemic. The pandemic has presented '
         'unprecedented business challenges, and the corporation has '
         'experienced impacts in each business area related to COVID-19, '
         'primarily in increased coronavirus-related costs, delays in supplier '
         'deliveries, impacts of travel restrictions, access to some '
         'locations, and the impacts of remote work and adjusted work '
         'schedules. Despite these challenges, the corporation and U.S. '
         "Government's proactive efforts, especially with regard to the supply "
         'chain, helped to partially mitigate the disruptions caused by '
         "COVID-19 on the corporation's operations in the second quarter. In "
         'addition, favorable contract award timing and strong performance '
         "more than offset the impacts of COVID-19 on the corporation's "
         'financial results in the first half of 2020. Given the results '
         'year-to-date and expectations for the remainder of 2020, the '
         'corporation is updating its 2020 guidance for net sales, segment '
         'operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations to '
         'reflect the recent performance across all four business areas. '
         "However, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the corporation's "
         'financial outlook in 2020 and future periods remains uncertain. The '
         "corporation's 2020 outlook assumes, among other things, that its "
         'production facilities continue to operate and it does not experience '
         'significant work stoppages or closures, it is able to mitigate any '
         'supply chain disruptions and these do not worsen, and it is able to '
         'recover its costs under U.S. Government contracts and government '
         "funding priorities do not change. While these are the corporation's "
         'current assumptions for its 2020 outlook, they could change because '
         "the future impact of COVID-19 on the corporation's operations and "
         "financial performance, including the corporation's ability to "
         'execute programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and '
         'will depend on future developments, including the duration and '

         'government, state and local government officials, and international '

         'cash activities in the second quarter of 2020 included the '
         'following: In May 2020 , the corporation received net proceeds of '
         '$1.13 billion from a $1.15 billion debt issuance of senior unsecured '
         'notes, consisting of $400 million aggregate principal amount of '
         '1.85% Notes due 2030 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of '
         '2.80% Notes due 2050. In June 2020 , the corporation used the net '
         'proceeds from the May 2020 debt offering plus cash on hand to redeem '
         '$750 million of the outstanding $1.25 billion in aggregate principal '
         'amount of the 2.50% Notes due 2020, and $400 million of the '
         'outstanding $900 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.35% '
         'Notes due 2021. As a result of these transactions, as of June 28, '

         'Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition '

         'retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset '
         'impairments, gains or losses from significant divestitures, and '
         'other miscellaneous corporate activities. The corporation recovers '
         'CAS pension cost through the pricing of its products and services on '
         'U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension '
         "cost in each of its business segments' net sales and cost of sales. "
         "The corporation's consolidated financial statements must present "
         'pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in '
         'accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles '
         '(referred to as FAS expense). The operating portion of the net '
         'FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the '
         'service cost component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. '
         'The non-service FAS pension expense component is included in other '
         "non-operating expense on the corporation's consolidated statements "
         'of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or '
         'decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense (both '
         'service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating profit '
         'generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer '
         'to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting '
         'from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service '
         'levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating '
         'profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a '
         "particular contract. In addition, comparability of the corporation's "
         'segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted '
         'favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the '
         "corporation's contracts for which it recognizes revenue over time "
         'using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure '
         'progress towards completion. Increases in profit booking rates, '
         'typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to '
         'revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance '
         'obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular '
         'contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may '
         'deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs '
         'to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit '
         'booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are '
         'recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date '
         'effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also '
         'be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or '
         'may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive '
         'resolution of contractual matters, insurance recoveries and gains on '
         'sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse '
         'resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for '
         'significant severance actions which are excluded from segment '
         'operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; '
         "and losses on sales of certain assets. The corporation's "
         'consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net '
         'profit booking rate adjustments, represented approximately 27 '

         'Martin [NYSE: LMT] successfully flight tested the second AGM-183A '
         'Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) on the service’s B-52 '
         'Stratofortress out of Edwards Air Force Base, California, on Aug. 8, '
         '2020. This captive carry flight was conducted with tactical hardware '
         'and fully instrumented to collect thermal, mechanical and digital '
         'data from the flight vehicle. This is the first time a tactical ARRW '
         'missile has been assembled. Additional ground and flight testing '
         'will follow over the next two years. “The team overcame significant '
         'challenges driven by the COVID-19 pandemic to achieve this '
         'significant milestone for the program,” said Dave Berganini, ARRW '
         'program director at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. “This '
         'captive carry mission is the pre-cursor for our first booster test '
         'flight planned for early 2020s.” Hypersonic weapons provide rapid '
         'response, time critical capability that will overcome distance in '
         'contested environments using high speed, altitude and '
         'maneuverability. An operational hypersonic air-launched weapon '
         'enables the U.S. to hold fixed, high value, time-sensitive targets '
         'at risk in contested environments from stand-off distances. Lockheed '
         'Martin has played a significant role in the research, development '
         'and demonstration of hypersonic technologies for more than 30 years. '
         'The corporation has made significant investments in key technology '

 'text': 'COLORADO SPRINGS , Colo., Aug. 31, 2020 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: '
         'LMT) and Ball Aerospace successfully completed a phased array '
         'transmit test for a Multi-Band, Multi-Mission (MBMM) antenna. MBMM '
         'helps enable multiple satellites to simultaneously connect with a '
         'single-phased array antenna system using multiple frequencies. It '
         'increases throughput, while also shrinking the antenna’s footprint. '
         'This marks a technology milestone for the United States Space '
         'Force’s MBMM program and moves the team one step closer to a full '
         'end-to-end satellite communication demonstration later this summer. '
         'This transmit test follows a similar successful receive test, which '
         'occurred in February. The prototype antenna, awarded by the Defense '
         'Innovation Unit in April 2019 , features proven technologies at high '
         'maturity levels like Lockheed Martin’s Horizon™ advanced satellite '
         'scheduler, Ball Aerospace’s modular subarray and panel design, and '
         'Kratos RT Logic advanced digital signal processing. Additionally, '
         'the prototype uses a ‘building block’ approach that can easily scale '
         'as the number of satellites increases or as the communication needs '
         'evolve. “We are excited to partner with the Space Force on this '
         'phased array technology demonstration. This is a collaborative team '
         'with proven leadership in fielding large-scale L- and S-band '
         'communication phased arrays,” said Maria Demaree, vice president and '
         'general manager of Lockheed Martin Mission Solutions. “Our '
         'experience integrating antennas into C2 systems is unparalled.” The '
         'total number of commercial and military satellites in orbit is '
         'projected to increase at least four-fold in the next decade, with a '
         'projected tenfold increase in capacity needed within the Air Force '
         'Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). That growth necessitates new '
         'technologies like phased arrays which can connect to multiple space '
         'vehicles simultaneously, unlike traditional parabolic antennas. '
         'Phased array antennas also avoid significant mechanical maintenance '
         'costs when compared to parabolic dishes. “Ball Aerospace has '
         'targeted investment in the core phased array technologies required '
         'to allow MBMM to address the Space Force’s mission needs while '
         'providing an affordable full system solution,” said Jake Sauer, vice '
         'president and general manager, Tactical Solutions, Ball Aerospace. '
         '“With the successful completion of the transmit test, we are looking '
         'forward to the full end-to-end mission demonstration of the phased '
         'array capability.” The MBMM prototype phased array is part of a '
         'broad initiative to modernize the existing AFSCN system and bring '
         'new technology faster to warfighters. MBMM increases AFSCN capacity '
         'and throughput while improving resiliency for ground infrastructure '

 'text': 'SUNNYVALE, Calif. ,\xa0June 22, 2020 – The world’s most advanced '
         'missile defense satellite recently and successfully came out of '
         'almost two months of harsh simulated space environmental testing. On '
         'June 9, the U.S. Space Force’s fifth Space Based Infrared System '
         'Geosynchronous Earth Orbit satellite ( SBIRS GEO-5 ) successfully '
         'completed Thermal Vacuum (TVAC) testing at Lockheed Martin (NYSE: '
         'LMT)’s Sunnyvale, California satellite manufacturing facility. '
         'Completing TVAC was a significant milestone for the first military '
         'space satellite to be built on one of Lockheed Martin’s modernized '
         'LM 2100™ satellite buses. During TVAC testing, the satellite – with '
         'its sophisticated electronics performing full operations – faced '
         'waves of heat and cold in a depressurized atmosphere similar to the '
         'drastic environmental changes experienced in space. “The completion '
         'of TVAC can be attributed to a tremendous effort from the Air Force, '
         'Lockheed Martin, Aerospace Corporation, and supporting contractor '
         'teams,” said Tucker White, SBIRS GEO-5 Assembly, Test, and Launch '
         'Operations Lead from the Government Program Office. “The teams '
         'worked around the clock and finished on schedule to their original '
         'projection. This test phase is vital to any space vehicle test '
         'regime and takes GEO-5 one step closer to providing enhanced missile '
         'detection to our warfighters.” SBIRS GEO-5 will join the Space '
         'Force’s constellation of missile warning satellites equipped, with '
         'powerful scanning and staring infrared surveillance sensors, which '
         'protect our nation 24-7. These sensors collect data that allow the '
         'U.S. military to detect missile launches, support ballistic missile '
         'defense, expand technical intelligence gathering and bolster '
         'situational awareness on the battlefield. “In SBIRS GEO-5, and our '
         'next satellite GEO-6, we’re introducing game-changing enhancements '
         'to address the needs of our nation’s space warfighting force going '
         'forward,” said Tom McCormick, Vice President for Overhead Persistent '
         'Infrared (OPIR) Missions at Lockheed Martin Space. “The threat posed '
         'by ballistic missile technology continues to spread exponentially '
         'around the world.\xa0In 2019, SBIRS detected nearly a thousand '
         'missile launches globally, which is about a two-fold increase in two '
         'years.” No “Ordinary” Missile Defense Satellite SBIRS GEO-5 is the '
         'first of two new SBIRS missile defense satellites and the fourth '
         'satellite built on Lockheed Martin’s new, modernized LM 2100 '
         'satellite bus . A major investment by Lockheed Martin, the LM 2100 '
         'purposefully focuses on increasing production speed, reducing costs, '
         'adding resiliency and building in more mission flexibility. The LM '
         '2100: “As we build more military LM 2100 satellites, we gain '
         'schedule efficiencies both from suppliers and the ability to enable '
         'concurrent bus and payload testing, which shortens the single line '
         'manufacturing flow,” McCormick explained. LM 2100 is currently '
         'slated to be the baseline bus of SBIRS GEO-5, and SBIRS GEO-6, '
         'expected to be launched in 2021 and 2022 respectively; three next '
         'Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared System (Next Gen OPIR) '
         'Block 0 GEO satellites expecting to launch starting in 2025; and the '
         'future GPS III Follow On (GPS IIIF) satellites, which are expected '
         'to launch starting in 2026. Upgraded SBIRS Ground The sophisticated '
         'SBIRS ground control system has had significant upgrades. SBIRS '
         'receives and processes large amounts of data from the global '
         'coverage of the satellites’ powerful sensors and converts this data '
         'into actionable reports for defense, intelligence and civil '
         'applications. In August 2019, the U.S. Air Force operationally '
         'accepted Lockheed Martin’s Block 20 upgrade to the SBIRS ground '
         'control system, which improves its overall performance allowing '
         'better mission planning and processing for the full constellation, '
         'as well as enhanced cyber security defenses. The upgrade also '
         'formally completed SBIRS’ Engineering & Manufacturing Development '
         '(EMD) Phase. This let the Air Force transition their focus to SBIRS’ '
         'operations and sustainment, as well as further enhanced capabilities '
         'that will be offered by the Next Gen OPIR system, and the Future '

         'Marinette Marine marked the beginning of construction on Littoral '
         'Combat Ship (LCS) 29, the future USS Beloit, with a ceremony in '
         'Marinette. As part of a ship-building tradition dating back '
         'centuries, a shipyard worker welded into the ship’s keel plate the '
         'initials of Major General Marcia M. Anderson (U.S. Army, Retired), '
         'USS Beloit ship sponsor and a Beloit, Wisconsin, native. This plate '
         'will be affixed to the ship and travel with Beloit throughout its '
         'commissioned life. LCS 29 will be the 15 th Freedom-variant LCS and '
         'will join a class of more than 30 ships. To date, four '
         'Freedom-variant LCS have deployed to support U.S. Navy presence and '
         'peacekeeping missions. In May, LCS 7 (USS Detroit) partnered with a '
         'U.S. Navy destroyer and Coast Guard teams to serve interdiction '
         'missions in the U.S. Southern Command Area of Responsibility. “With '
         'two deployments so far this year, Freedom-variant LCS have proven '
         'that they are capable and can serve a unique role in the U.S. Navy’s '
         'fleet,” said Joe DePietro, vice president and general manager of '
         'Small Combatants and Ship Systems. “LCS’ speed, maneuverability and '
         'flexibility allows the ship to serve a multitude of missions by '
         'quickly integrating equipment and deploying manned and unmanned '
         'aerial, surface or sub-surface vehicles.” In total, there are more '
         'than 500,000 nautical miles under the keel of Freedom-variant LCS. '
         'The ship delivers advanced capability in anti-submarine, surface, '
         'and mine countermeasure missions, and was designed to evolve with '
         'the changing security environment. As near-peer competition from '
         'large nation states increases, Lockheed Martin is partnering with '
         'the Navy to evolve LCS to meet these threats. Targeted upgrades are '
         'already underway with naval strike missiles being installed in '
         'support of upcoming deployments. Future installs of improved '
         'electronic warfare and decoy launching systems are under '
         'development. LCS 29 is the first Navy ship to be named after Beloit, '
         'Wisconsin, and the ship’s sponsor has personal ties to Beloit. '
         'During a long career with the U.S. military, Major General Anderson '
         'became the first African American woman to obtain the rank of major '
         'general in the U. S. Army and U. S. Army Reserve. As a '
         'citizen-soldier, Anderson was employed for 28 years by the United '
         'States Courts, where she served as the Clerk of the Bankruptcy '
         'Court, Western District of Wisconsin, located in Madison, Wisconsin, '
         'until her retirement in late 2019. "The construction of the Navy’s '
         'newest Littoral Combat Ship and naming it after the city of Beloit, '
         'with its rich and storied history of supporting our nation’s '
         'national security, is more than fitting,” said Major General '
         'Anderson. “When completed, the USS Beloit’s voyages will be part of '
         'the tradition of small cities and towns in America sharing our story '
         'around the world." Beloit is one of six LCS in various stages of '
         'construction and test at the Fincantieri Marinette Marine shipyard. '
         '“We are proud to celebrate the future USS Beloit today,” said Jan '
         'Allman, CEO of Fincantieri Marinette Marine. “The Fincantieri '
         'Marinette Marine shipyard is honored to build this capable warship, '
         'named for another city from the wonderful state of Wisconsin. I '
         'think this is a true testament to the hard work and patriotism of '
         'Midwesterners, and we look forward to working with the City of '
         'Beloit as we continue building LCS 29 for our US Navy partner.” For '

 'text': 'FORT WORTH, Texas , May 19, 2020 / PRNewswire / --\xa0In response to '
         'previously reported COVID-19 F-35 supplier delays, Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE: LMT) is taking proactive measures to mitigate impacts and '
         'position the program for the fastest possible recovery by adjusting '
         'work schedules, maintaining specialized employee skillsets, and '
         'accelerating payments to small and vulnerable suppliers, to continue '
         'meeting customer commitments.     Today Lockheed Martin and the '
         'International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) '
         'agreed to a temporary alternate work schedule for F-35 production '
         'line employees in Fort Worth to maintain their skilled workforce. '
         'The new schedule, which will begin May 23 , divides each shift into '
         'three groups. On a rotation, each group will work for two weeks and '
         'then will have a week off. During the adjusted three-week work '
         'schedule, employees who work 96 hours or more will be compensated an '
         'additional 24 hours for their off week while receiving full pay and '
         'benefits. The alternate schedule allows Lockheed Martin to staff the '
         'production line to meet a slower workflow resulting from supplier '
         'delays. In addition, it provides a work rhythm that retains the '
         'expertise of the talented workforce and provides opportunities to '
         'adjust work to better support production. "These are challenging '
         'times, but managing tough challenges is when the F-35 program '
         'performs at its best. The alternate work schedule maintains the '
         'specialized skillset of the employees and provides opportunities to '
         'for us to adjust our workflow to account for supplier delays due to '
         'COVID-19," said Aeronautics Executive Vice President Michele Evans . '
         '"Our F-35 workforce is the best in the world at what they do, and we '
         'will continue to deliver on our customer\'s mission." The temporary '
         'alternate work schedule agreement will continue for its first '
         'three-week cycle. The company will then evaluate business needs and '
         'can alter the schedule as needed with the option to discontinue as '
         'warranted or continue until Sept. 4 . Lockheed Martin and the IAM '
         'have also agreed to allow employees to volunteer to be furloughed '
         'for 30 days where they maintain their benefits but forgo pay during '
         'this period. For additional information, visit '

         'Joint Program Office and the U.S. Air Force successfully connected '
         'the F-35, F-22, F-16 and E3 Sentry in a highly contested simulated '
         'environment during a Distributed Mission Training final acceptance '
         'test at Nellis AFB, Nevada. This simulated training event was the '
         'first time these platforms were connected virtually. Additional '
         'platforms such as the F-15 can also connect into this shared virtual '
         'environment. The F-35 DMT capability creates interoperability across '
         'military platforms for continuation training and large force '
         'exercises. The initial delivery at Nellis AFB is a major step '
         'forward as it establishes the framework for F-35 simulators around '
         'the world to interconnect. Previously, F-35 simulators allowed up to '
         'four pilots at a facility to fly together in simulated combat. DMT '
         'links pilots at Nellis AFB to pilots at other bases through an '
         'existing distributed network enabling simulated training events with '
         'existing 4 th generation and 5 th generation platforms. This is the '
         'first of many fielded DMT solutions for the F-35 training '

         'truly train like they fight by enabling advanced tactics training '

         'Chauncey McIntosh, Lockheed Martin, vice president of F-35 Training '

         'Force Test Pilot School, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Skunk Works ® '
         'successfully demonstrated an autonomous Intelligence, Surveillance '
         'and Reconnaissance (ISR) system to enhance operational effectiveness '
         'for the warfighter in denied communications environments. “As a '
         'remotely piloted aircraft pilot, having the opportunity to test an '
         'emerging technology and see it perform functions required for '
         'operations in denied communications environments sparks the '
         'imagination of what is possible in future ISR systems,” said Capt. '
         'Josh Rountree, Test Management Project Lead at the U.S. Air Force '
         'Test Pilot School . Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, '
         'the autonomous ISR system, integrated into an F-16 through a '
         'Lockheed Martin-developed pod solution, was able to detect and '
         'identify the location of the target, automatically route to the '
         'target, and capture an image to confirm the target in a simulated, '
         'denied communications environment. Using an autonomous ISR system to '
         'penetrate contested environments and gather critical intelligence '
         'for effective decision making when standard communication between '
         'systems is not an option keeps the warfighter out of harm’s way '
         'while still achieving mission objectives. “As the battlespace '
         'becomes increasingly contested, human-machine teams will enable '
         'operators to collect critical intelligence in denied communications '
         'environments, ensuring our warfighters get information they need '
         'when they need it,” said George Hellstern, Lockheed Martin Skunk '
         'Works ® program manager for artificial intelligence solutions. “We '
         'are proud to partner to advance a novel capability, allowing the '
         'warfighter to adapt in a rapidly changing operational environment '
         'and still get critical data to perform the mission.” Lockheed Martin '
         'Skunk Works has decades of experience developing trusted autonomous '
         'and artificial intelligence technologies to help humans maximize '
         'safety, performance and situational awareness across land, sea, air, '

 'text': 'Der schwere Transporthubschrauber CH-53K King Stallion hat Ende Juni '
         'eine umfassende Testreihe auf einem Hubschrauberträger der US Navy '
         'erfolgreich abgeschlossen. Die Erprobung, die rund 14 Tage im '
         'Atlantischen Ozean stattfand, umfasste das Starten und Landen von '
         'verschiedenen Deckspositionen bei Tag und Nacht unter schweren '
         'Wetterbedingungen, Tests der automatischen Rotorfaltanlage sowie '
         'diverse Kompatibilitätstests an Bord. Damit hat der '
         'Transporthubschrauber des zu Lockheed Martin gehörenden Unternehmens '
         'Sikorsky einen der letzten Meilensteine auf dem Weg zur anstehenden '
         'Einsatzverlegung durch das US Marine Corps erreicht. Der '
         'US-Hubschrauber Hersteller nimmt mit der CH-53K auch an der '
         'laufenden Ausschreibung „Schwerer Transporthubschrauber“ (STH) der '
         'Bundeswehr teil. Das Luftfahrzeug absolvierte ab Anfang Juni '
         'insgesamt mehr als 360 Starts und Landungen auf dem '
         'Hubschrauberträger (Landing Helicopter Dock – LHD) USS Wasp unter '
         'teils sehr anspruchsvollen Bedingungen, um dessen Befähigung auf See '
         'realistisch zu erproben. So wurde der Hubschrauber bei '
         'unterschiedlichsten Windverhältnissen geflogen. Zudem wurde er an '
         'Deck und in den Wartungs-Hangar geschleppt sowie mit verschiedenen '
         'Verankerungsverfahren in unterschiedlichen Seegängen gesichert. Die '
         'an Bord befindliche Wartungscrew der CH-53K überprüfte in diesem '
         'Zeitraum die Durchführbarkeit verschiedener '
         'Routine-Wartungstätigkeiten zur Sicherstellung des Flugbetriebs. '
         '„Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Verlauf der Tests", sagte Oberst '
         'Jack Perrin, Programmmanager für schwere H-53-Hubschrauber beim U.S. '
         'Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). „Wir hatten Gelegenheit, Start '
         'und Landung der CH-53K bei Tag, Nacht u.a. mit Nachtsichtgeräten, zu '
         'evaluieren. Wir sind mittlerweile an einem Punkt, bei dem wir alle '
         'Elemente erfolgreich abgearbeitet haben, um unsere Besatzungen und '
         'das Luftfahrzeug sicher in den Einsatz verlegen zu können. Alle '
         'Besatzungen waren beeindruckt, wie viel einfacher und sicherer es '
         'ist, mit der Unterstützung des „Fly-by-Wire“-Flugsteuerungssystems, '
         'das Flugdeck anzufliegen und den Hubschrauber zu landen.“ Major '
         'Joshua Foxton, Testpilot beim „Air Test and Evaluation Squadron TWO '
         'ONE“ (HX-21), war verantwortlich für die Planung und Durchführung '
         'dieser Maßnahme und verdeutlicht als CH-53E Pilot den Unterschied '
         'zwischen den verschiedenen Luftfahrzeuggenerationen: „Eine Landung '
         'auf einem Schiff bei Nacht und geringer Ausleuchtung ist so ziemlich '
         'das schwierigste, was wir im Marine Corps in diesem Einsatzbereich '
         'durchführen. Es gibt so gut wie keine Horizontreferenz und nur '
         'unzureichende visuelle Indikatoren um die Annäherungsgeschwindigkeit '
         'an das Schiff richtig einschätzen zu können. In der CH-53E mussten '
         'wir dafür über Monate trainieren, um sichere und einsatzbereite '
         'Besatzungen hervorbringen zu können. Im Gegensatz dazu erlaubt die '
         'Flugsteuerung und Stabilisierung der CH-53K nahezu einen komplett '
         'automatischen („hands-off") Anflug und Landung. Bisher habe ich mich '
         'in diesem Szenario noch nie so sicher gefühlt und die Möglichkeit '
         'mich nebenbei noch anderen wichtigen Aufgaben in der '
         'Missionsdurchführung widmen zu können, war absolut beeindruckend.“ '
         'Bill Falk, Direktor des CH-53K Programms bei Sikorsky: „Die CH-53K '
         'hat sich während ihrer ersten Erprobung auf See und in der '
         'Durchführung von mehr als 360 Starts und Landung eindeutig bewährt. '
         'Das Luftfahrzeug ist seiner Einsatzverlegung damit wieder einen '
         'Schritt näher gekommen.“ Das U.S. Marine Corps plant, 2021 mit der '
         'Einsatzprüfung und -vorbereitung der CH-53K zu beginnen und den '
         'Hubschrauber 2023/24 erstmalig in den Einsatz zu verlegen. Nach der '
         'erfolgreichen Durchführung von Luftbetankungstests sowie der '
         'Erprobung unter erschwerten Sichtbedingungen (DVE) haben die '
         'jüngsten Tests auf See erneut belegt, dass das Testprogramm des '
         'Hubschraubers wie geplant voranschreitet. In den kommenden Wochen '
         'werden darüber hinaus weitere Flüge mit Fahrzeugen und schwerem '
         'Gerät als Innen- sowie Außenlast in großen Höhen und bei hohen '
         'Temperaturen („hot&high“) durchgeführt. Positives Zeichen für '
         'deutschen STH-Wettbewerb Im deutschen STH-Wettbewerb läuft derzeit '
         'die Verhandlungsphase zwischen den Bietern und dem Bundesamt für '
         'Ausrüstung, Informationstechnik und Nutzung der Bundeswehr '
         '(BAAINBw). Eine Entscheidung über die Vergabe soll noch im ersten '
         'Quartal des kommenden Jahres fallen. Christian Albrecht, '
         'International Business Development Manager bei Sikorsky, sieht den '
         'erfolgreichen Abschluss der jüngsten Testreihe auch als positives '
         'Zeichen für den deutschen Wettbewerb: „Die Erprobung auf See, welche '
         'eine Schnittmenge zur möglichen Nutzung eines STH in der Bundeswehr '
         'sowie im Einsatz mit Bündnispartnern darstellt, zeigt die '
         'vielseitigen Einsatzmöglichkeiten der CH-53K. Im Rahmen der Tests '
         'wird deutlich, dass es sich bei der CH-53K um den modernsten, '
         'intelligentesten und leistungsfähigsten Transporthubschrauber am '
         'Markt handelt. Der baldige Abschluss der Erprobungsphase sichert die '
         'Lieferung eines einsatzbereiten, voll leistungsfähigen schweren '
         'Transporthubschraubers an die Bundeswehr.“ Während der jüngsten '
         'Tests auf See wurde auch die automatische Rotorfaltanlage des '
         'Hubschraubers erfolgreich genutzt. In weniger als 2 Minuten können '
         'per Knopfdruck die Hauptrotorblätter sowie der Heckrotor geklappt '
         'werden, um den Platzbedarf des Hubschraubers signifikant zu '
         'reduzieren. Eine Funktionalität, die bereits in der aktuellen Flotte '
         'der CH-53G in der Bundeswehr seit Jahrzehnten zur Anwendung kommt '
         'und als Alleinstellungsmerkmal der CH-53K den nahtlosen Übergang in '
         'der bestehenden Infrastruktur an den zukünftigen STH Standorten in '
         'Holzdorf und Laupheim garantieren würde. So könnten langwierige '
         'Infrastrukturmaßnahmen und Folgekosten vermieden und die '
         'Interoperabilität im Einsatz der CH-53K von anderen '
         'Hubschrauberstandorten der Bundeswehr sichergestellt werden. '
         'Hintergrund: Bereits frühzeitig hat Sikorsky für das STH-Projekt '
         'gemeinsam mit dem deutschen Technologieunternehmen Rheinmetall ein '
         'Kernteam aus namhaften deutschen Industrieunternehmen gebildet. Dazu '
         'zählen MTU Aero Engines, Autoflug GmbH und Hydro Systems KG. Etwa '
         'zehn Prozent der Produktion und 70 Prozent der Wartungsarbeiten '
         'werden daher in Deutschland erfolgen. Die deutsche Industrie '
         'profitiert aktuellen Schätzungen zufolge von einem Auftragsvolumen '
         'in Höhe von ca. einer Milliarde Euro. Darüber hinaus sollen bis zu '
         '500 hochqualifizierte zusätzliche Arbeitsplätze in Deutschland '
         'geschaffen werden. Im Falle einer erfolgreichen Bewerbung wollen '
         'Sikorsky und Rheinmetall am Flughafen Leipzig/Halle ein '
         'Logistikzentrum sowie ein STH-Flotten-Unterstützungszentrum '
         'aufbauen. Wie die beiden Unternehmen bereits Ende Oktober 2019 '
         'ankündigten, befinden sie sich dazu in fortgeschrittenen Gesprächen '

         'recently delivered the first KC-130J Super Hercules tanker assigned '
         'to Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 452 (VMGR-452), the '
         'Marine Forces Reserve squadron at Stewart Air National Guard Base, '
         'New York. A U.S. Marine Corps crew ferried the aircraft from '
         'Lockheed Martin’s facility here on May 28 to the aircraft’s new '
         'home. VMGR-452 is the second Marine Reserve squadron to operate '
         'KC-130Js and this delivery signifies the recapitalization of the '
         'squadron’s existing KC-130T fleet. VMGR-452 — known as the Yankees — '
         'has operated Hercules tankers for more than 30 years, flying KC-130s '
         'in support of Operations Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi '
         'Freedom. “The KC-130 Hercules tanker has been a pivotal part of '
         'Marine Corps aviation operations since 1960, a relationship that '
         'began with the KC-130F and R-models, transitioned to the KC-130T and '
         'continues now with the KC-130J Super Hercules,” said Rod McLean, '
         'vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin’s Air Mobility '
         '& Maritime Missions line of business. “Our C-130 team knows this '
         'delivery is significant and represents increased capability for '
         'VMGR-452. We are proud to support our Marine aviation partners as '
         'they continue to be ‘first to fight\'." KC-130s are operated in '
         'support of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commander by '
         'providing tactical in-flight refueling for fixed-wing, rotary-wing, '
         'and tilt-rotor aircraft; aviation delivered ground refueling of '
         'aircraft or tactical vehicles; assault air transport or air-landed '
         'or aerial-delivered (parachute) personnel and equipment; pathfinder '
         'support, battlefield illumination; tactical aeromedical evacuation; '
         'and tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel support. The proven '
         'and battle-tested KC-130J builds on the Hercules’ proven tanker '
         'refueling system while taking full advantage of the tremendous '
         'technological and performance enhancements found only in a Super '
         'Hercules. Compared to legacy models, the KC-130J delivers increased '
         'speed and fuel efficiency, improved payload/range capabilities, an '
         'integrated defensive suite, automated maintenance fault reporting, '
         'high-altitude ramp and door hydraulics, and unmatched situational '
         'awareness with its digital avionics and dual Head Up Displays. The '
         'KC-130J is one of nine production variants of the C-130J Super '
         'Hercules, the current production model of the legendary C-130 '
         'Hercules aircraft. With 460+ aircraft delivered, the C‑130J is the '
         'airlifter of choice for 20 nations. The global Super Hercules fleet '
         'has more than 2 million flight hours of experience supporting almost '
         'any mission requirement — anytime, anywhere. The U.S. Marine Corps '
         'has the distinction of operating the largest KC-130J Super Hercules '
         'fleet in the world. This delivery continues the U.S. government’s '

         'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the '
         'World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. '
         'Government in March 2020 and has negatively affected the U.S. and '
         'global economy, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in '
         'significant travel and transport restrictions, including mandated '
         'closures and orders to "shelter-in-place," and created significant '
         'disruption of the financial markets.\xa0Lockheed Martin has taken '
         'measures to protect the health and safety of its employees, work '
         'with its customers to minimize potential disruptions and support its '
         'community in addressing the challenges posed by this global '
         'pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the '
         "corporation's operational and financial performance, including its "
         'ability to execute its programs in the expected timeframe, will '
         'depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of '
         'the pandemic and related actions taken by the U.S. Government, state '
         'and local government officials, and international governments to '
         'prevent disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be '
         'predicted.\xa0The outbreak did not have a material impact on the '
         "corporation's operating results or business in the first quarter of "
         '2020. However, the corporation is beginning to experience some '
         'issues in each of its business areas related to COVID-19, primarily '
         'in access to some locations and delays of supplier deliveries.\xa0'
         'The corporation is updating its 2020 guidance for net sales to '
         'reflect these impacts, as production and supply chain activities '
         'have recently slowed in the Aeronautics business area. However, the '
         "ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the corporation's 2020 outlook for "
         'sales, segment operating profit, earnings and cash flows from '
         "operations remains uncertain. The corporation's 2020 outlook "
         'assumes, among other things, that its production facilities continue '
         'to operate and it does not experience significant work stoppages or '
         'closures, it is able to mitigate any supply chain disruptions and '
         'these do not worsen, and it is able to recover its costs under '
         'contracts and government funding priorities do not change. In '
         "addition, the corporation's financial performance assumes actual "
         'returns on its pension assets during 2020 will be 7.0%, and the '
         'discount rate used to re-measure its pension liabilities at year-end '
         '2020 will be 3.25%.\xa0 Differences between these assumed values and '
         "actual values will affect the corporation's plan funded status and "
         "stockholders' equity as measured at year-end 2020. The corporation "
         'is also monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on the fair value of its '
         'assets. While the corporation does not currently anticipate any '
         'material impairments on its assets as a result of COVID-19, future '
         'changes in expectations for sales, earnings and cash flows related '
         'to intangible assets and goodwill below its current projections '
         'could cause these assets to be impaired. While these are the '
         "corporation's current assumptions, this is an emerging situation and "
         'these could change, including if the duration of the pandemic is '
         'extended, which could affect outlook. Investment in Advanced '
         'Military Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul Center LLC (AMMROC) As of '
         'March\xa029, 2020, the corporation had an investment in the AMMROC '
         'joint venture with a carrying value of $435 million . Substantially '
         "all of AMMROC's current business is dependent on a single customer "
         'contract to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services '
         'for fixed and rotary wing military aircraft that was up for '
         're-competition. In April 2020 , subsequent to the end of the '
         "corporation's first quarter, the customer announced its intent to "
         'award the contract to a competitor. The corporation is working with '
         "AMMROC's management and its joint venture partner to understand its "
         'options, including whether there is a basis to challenge the award '
         'and retain the MRO services, explore the possibility of AMMROC '
         'continuing to provide MRO services as a subcontractor to the '
         'competitor, an opportunity to replace the contract with other '
         'customer arrangements, or winding down the business. At this time, '
         'the corporation cannot determine the extent of the non-cash '
         'impairment charge, if any, related to its investment. However, if '
         'the customer moves forward with transitioning the MRO services to '
         'the competitor and AMMROC is not a subcontractor (or has only a '
         'limited role), the corporation expects there would be an adverse '
         "impact to AMMROC's business and the carrying value of its "
         'investment, which could be significant and an impairment could occur '
         'as early as the second quarter of 2020. Other than the impact to '
         'earnings for a potential non-cash impairment charge, currently the '
         'corporation does not expect any other significant impacts to its '
         '2020 operating results, financial position or cash flows. Cash '
         "Activities The corporation's cash activities in the first quarter of "
         '2020 included the following: Segment Results The corporation '
         'operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of '
         'products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire '
         'Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. The '
         'following table presents summary operating results of the '

         "corporation's business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of "
         'sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in '
         "consolidation. Operating profit of the corporation's business "
         "segments includes the corporation's share of earnings or losses from "
         'equity method investees as the operating activities of the investees '
         'are closely aligned with the operations of its business segments. '
         "Operating profit of the corporation's business segments also "
         'excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment described below, a portion '
         'of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to '
         'contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. '
         'Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition '
         'regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of '
         "management's evaluation of segment operating performance such as a "
         'portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and '
         'settlements, environmental costs, stock-based compensation expense, '
         'retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset '
         'impairments, gains or losses from significant divestitures, and '
         'other miscellaneous corporate activities. The corporation recovers '
         'CAS pension cost through the pricing of its products and services on '
         'U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension '
         "cost in each of its business segments' net sales and cost of sales. "
         "The corporation's consolidated financial statements must present "
         'pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in '
         'accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles '
         '(referred to as FAS expense). The operating portion of the net '
         'FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the '
         'service cost component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. '
         'The non-service FAS pension expense component is included in other '
         "non‑operating expense on the corporation's consolidated statements "
         'of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or '
         'decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense (both '
         'service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating profit '
         'generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer '
         'to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting '
         'from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service '
         'levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating '
         'profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a '
         "particular contract. In addition, comparability of the corporation's "
         'segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted '
         'favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the '
         "corporation's contracts for which it recognizes revenue over time "
         'using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure '
         'progress towards completion. Increases in profit booking rates, '
         'typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to '
         'revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance '
         'obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular '
         'contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may '
         'deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs '
         'to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit '
         'booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are '
         'recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date '
         'effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also '
         'be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or '
         'may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive '
         'resolution of contractual matters, insurance recoveries and gains on '
         'sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse '
         'resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for '
         'significant severance actions which are excluded from segment '
         'operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; '
         "and losses on sales of certain assets. The corporation's "
         'consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net '
         'profit booking rate adjustments, represented approximately 27 '
         'percent of total segment operating profit in the first quarter of '
         '2020 as compared to 33 percent in the first quarter of 2019. '

         'Technologies, and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) completed the first '
         'production Javelin F-Model (FGM-148F) missile. Javelin is a '
         'versatile, man-portable, fire-and-forget weapon system. The F-Model '
         'has an advanced, multipurpose warhead that can defeat current and '
         'future armor, including explosive reactive armor. The F-Model also '
         'adds a fragmenting steel case to take out soft targets and light '

         'blast fragmentation and high-explosive anti-tank into a single '
         'warhead,” said David Pantano, Javelin Joint Venture vice president '
         'and Lockheed Martin Javelin program director. “We’re helping prepare '
         'our warfighters for any mission by reducing the need for different '

         'combat operations in\xa0Afghanistan\xa0and Iraq. U.S. and coalition '
         'forces have used the Javelin in more than 5,000 engagements since '
         'its deployment in 1996. With orders for more than 45,000 Javelin '

 'text': 'Annapolis Junction, Maryland, April 29, 2020 – Electromagnetic '
         'spectrum and cyber domain capabilities are converging to provide '
         'advanced combat weapon systems for warfighters. In this area, the '
         'Consortium Management Group (CMG)/ Consortium for Command, Control '
         'and Communications in Cyberspace (C5), on behalf of the U.S. Army, '
         'awarded Lockheed Martin [NYSE:LMT] a Project Agreement to move into '
         'the second phase of development for the “Air Large” component of its '
         'Multi-Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) family of systems program. '
         'MFEW-AL leverages three years of Lockheed Martin’s internal research '
         'and development investment in an open architecture system that can '
         'be easily configured for a variety of airborne and ground platforms, '
         'such as a wing-mounted pod for Group 4 unmanned aerial systems. “Our '
         'internal research & development programs have resulted in '
         'first-of-its-kind converged technologies that are at the forefront '
         'of realizing our customers’ urgent need and vision for combined '
         'cyber and electronic warfare (EW) capability and dominance,” said '
         'Deon Viergutz, vice president of Lockheed Martin’s Spectrum '
         'Convergence division. “We have over 40 years of DoD airborne and '
         'ground EW product experience, combined with extensive Intelligence '
         'Community products and expertise. We used this to create a '
         'compelling Cyber/EW product suite for the Army that will continue to '
         'evolve to meet the emerging needs of our customers and overcome '
         'advances in adversary technologies.” Lockheed Martin’s partnership '
         'with the U.S. Army has resulted in the creation of an MFEW-AL system '
         'that provides extensive spectrum convergence capabilities for '
         'battlefield commanders. The MFEW-AL system conforms to the DoD '
         'C4ISR/EW Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS) open system '
         'standards to enable rapid cyber/EW technique development and '
         'deployment; interoperability of hardware and software across '
         'airborne and ground platforms; prompt insertion of new hardware '
         'technology; and significant reduction of total ownership costs. As a '
         'result, MFEW-AL systems will be able to rapidly adapt to a '
         'continuously evolving threat that optimizes support for warfighters. '

         '( AEHF-6 ) protected communications satellite is encapsulated in its '
         'protective fairings and mounted atop its rocket in preparation for '
         'its planned March 26 launch. The AEHF-6 satellite will bring '
         'additional capabilities and resilience to the constellation which '
         'already ensures “always-on” communications and the ability to '
         'transmit data anywhere, anytime. Once on orbit, AEHF-6 will complete '
         'the constellation, as well as mark the first launch under U.S. Space '
         'Force control. AEHF-6 will launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a '

 'text': 'MARIETTA, Georgia, April 2 , 20 20 — Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'delivered the U.S. Air Force Reserve’s first HC-130J Combat King II '
         'today to a crew from the 920th Rescue Wing (RQW) from Patrick Air '
         'Force Base, Florida. This HC-130J will be operated by the 39th '
         'Rescue Squadron (RQS), which is part of the 920th RQW. These '
         'Reservists are long-time operators of legacy HC-130 P/N Combat King '
         'combat search-and-rescue aircraft, flying and maintaining HC-130s '
         'since the 1960s — using HC-130s to save more than 3,000 lives. The '
         'HC-130J is the sole dedicated fixed-wing personnel recovery platform '
         'operated by the Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. '
         'The 920th RQW and 39th RQS also have the distinction of being the '
         'Air Force Reserve’s only HC-130J operators and will eventually have '
         'an HC-130J fleet to support mission requirements. Like others in the '
         'U.S. Air Force Rescue community, the 920th RQW and the 39th RQS live '
         'by the motto, "That Others May Live," which reflects the mission of '
         'supporting combat search and rescue anywhere in the world. These '
         'crews rely on HC-130s to also extend the range its HH-60 Pave Hawk '
         'combat search and rescue helicopters, which were manufactured by '
         'Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business in Stratford, Connecticut.  '
         'Often tasked for airdrop, airland, and helicopter air-to-air '
         'refueling and forward-area ground refueling missions, the HC-130’s '
         'mission capabilities also include humanitarian aid operations, '
         'disaster response, security cooperation/aviation advisory, emergency '
         'aeromedical evacuation and noncombatant evacuation operations.  '
         '“From supporting humanitarian relief efforts on the Florida coast to '
         'making combat rescues in Southeast Asia, the 920th’s HC-130s have '
         'exemplified the reputation of being tried and true workhorses for 60 '
         'years,” said Rod McLean, vice president and general manager, Air '
         'Mobility & Maritime Missions at Lockheed Martin. “As we salute one '
         'fleet for a lifetime’s worth of work, we are also excited to '
         'commemorate a new era with the arrival of the U.S. Air Force '
         'Reserve’s first HC-130J Combat King II. This HC-130J provides the '
         'Citizen Airmen with increased power, capability and performance to '
         'continue to support critical missions close to home and around the '
         'world.”  Compared to legacy platforms, the HC-130J Combat King II '
         'offers significant performance and capabilities advancements, to '
         'include fuel efficiencies, improvement in payload/range '
         'capabilities, an integrated defensive suite, automated maintenance '
         'fault reporting, high-altitude ramp and door hydraulics, and '
         'unmatched situational awareness with its digital avionics and dual '
         'Head Up Displays. The HC-130J is one of nine production variants of '
         'the C-130J Super Hercules, the current production model of the '
         'legendary C-130 Hercules aircraft. With more than 450 aircraft '
         'delivered, the C-130J is the airlifter of choice for 20 nations. The '
         'global Super Hercules fleet has more than 2 million flight hours of '
         'experience supporting almost any mission requirement — any time, any '
         'place. The U.S. government operates the largest C-130J Super '
         'Hercules fleet in the world. This delivery continues the U.S. '
         "government's transition to the C-130J as the common platform across "
         'Air Mobility Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, Air '
         'Combat Command, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Marine Corps. The Air '

         'Milestone C decision by the Air Force, and award of the first Low '
         'Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract for 10 aircraft. The HH-60W '
         'is an all-new helicopter based on the proven UH-60M Black Hawk and '
         'customized for the U.S. Air Force\'s rescue mission. "This second '
         'contract award demonstrates the confidence the U.S. Air Force has in '

         'collaboration with our customer – to ensure we build and deliver '

         'Since achieving the Milestone C decision from the Air Force in '
         'September 2019 , which moved the CRH program into low rate initial '
         'production, the program continues to progress, reaching key '
         'milestones and executing an aggressive flight test schedule. '
         'Currently seven CRH aircraft are in flight, two of which are with '
         'the Air Force at Duke Field, Eglin Air Force Base in Florida , with '
         'all aircraft engaging in expanded flight tests to support the path '

         'production of\xa0CRH Lot 1 aircraft major assembly is underway, with '
         'Lot 2 assembly to follow. The program remains on track to meet '
         'contract delivery of RAA in 2020. The HH-60W arrived today at the '
         'Rosen Shingle Creek resort in Orlando , the site of the annual Air '
         'Force Association (AFA) Air Warfare Symposium, offering a first-hand '
         'look of the much-anticipated aircraft to service members who perform '
         'critical search and rescue operations.\xa0The Air Force also '
         'assigned the new helicopter its proper name – Jolly Green II – in a '
         'name reveal event hosted by Barbara M. Barrett , Secretary of the '
         'Air Force. View the reveal video here. "We respect the long '
         'tradition of assigning a moniker that communicates the CSAR mission. '
         'Jolly Green II is a fitting tribute to its history and to airmen and '
         'women worldwide," said Dana Fiatarone , Sikorsky\'s Vice President, '
         'Army and Air Force Systems. "The name is greatly respected by our '
         "workforce – past and present – and it's an honor to build this "
         'critical aircraft for the Air Force and bring it to the symposium '
         'today to provide our customer with the opportunity to view the Jolly '
         'Green II in person. We look forward to continued production and '
         'executing on the recent Lot 2 contract award." The HH-60W Combat '
         'Rescue Helicopter is significantly more capable and reliable than '
         'its predecessor, the HH-60G Pave Hawk. The aircraft hosts a new fuel '
         'system that nearly doubles the capacity of the main fuel tank on a '
         'UH-60M Black Hawk, giving the Air Force crew extended range and more '
         'capability to rescue those injured in the battle space. The HH-60W '
         'specification drives more capable defensive systems, vulnerability '
         'reduction, weapons, cyber-security, environmental, expanded adverse '
         'weather sensor capabilities, and more comprehensive net-centric '
         'requirements than currently held by the HH-60G. The U.S. Air Force '
         'program of record calls for 113 helicopters to replace the Pave '
         'Hawks, which perform critical combat search and rescue and personnel '

         'Capability ( M-MSTIC ) uses a commercial, off-the-shelf general '
         'purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to cost effectively receive '
         'and monitor M-Code signals. Operators can monitor the signal as '
         'needed. M-MSTIC complements MSTIC’s, which Lockheed Martin developed '
         'and fielded to replace aging hardware receivers that were becoming '
         'difficult and expensive to maintain. “Our warfighters depend on GPS '
         'signals every day for many critical missions, so anything we can do '
         'to make these signals more resistant to jamming and spoofing is '
         'extremely important – and available today,” said Johnathon Caldwell, '
         'Lockheed Martin Vice President of Navigation Systems. “The more '
         'powerful GPS III/IIIF satellites coupled with Lockheed Martin’s '
         'upgrades to the GPS ground system are making that possible.” Second '
         'GPS III satellite joins GPS Constellation On March 27, the Space '
         'Force declared Operational Acceptance of Lockheed Martin’s second '
         'GPS III satellite. Another M-Code enabled satellite, GPS III Space '
         "Vehicle 02 , “nicknamed Magellan,” is modernizing today's GPS "
         'satellite constellation with new 3x greater accuracy and up to 8x '
         'improved anti-jamming capabilities. GPS III also provides a new L1C '
         'civil signal, compatible with other international global navigation '
         "satellite systems, like\xa0Europe's\xa0Galileo. Lockheed Martin is "
         'currently contracted to build up to 32 GPS III/GPS III Follow On '
         '(GPS IIIF) satellites to help modernize the GPS constellation with '
         'new technology and advanced capabilities. The delivery tempo for '
         'these modernized GPS satellites will allow for several launches per '
         'year. The third M-code enabled GPS III satellite , named “Columbus,” '
         'is expected to launch in April, 2020 . Cyber security significantly '
         'hardened with Red Dragon Cyber Security Suite Cyber defenses across '
         'the upgraded GPS system were recently evaluated by a government '
         'assessment team and passed the Operational Utility Evaluation. '
         'Lockheed Martin delivered the Red Dragon Cybersecurity Suite (RDCSS) '
         'Phase III upgrade during the fourth quarter of 2019, dramatically '
         'improving Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) visibility into GPS '
         'network traffic. Other add-ons include user behavior analytics to '
         'analyze patterns of traffic and network taps to improve data '
         'collections. “GPS is an attractive target for our adversaries, so it '
         'was critical we bring our best cybersecurity defenses to the table,” '
         'said Stacy Kubicek, Vice President of Mission Solutions Defense and '
         'Security. “Since we began sustaining the Ground OCS in 2013, we have '
         'systematically upgraded and replaced software and hardware – it’s '
         'now a very secure system.” Lockheed Martin has sustained the GPS '
         'Ground OCS since 2013. In November of 2018, the team completed the '

 'text': 'DENVER, Colorado ,\xa0March 10, 2020 – The U.S. Space Force’s Space '
         'and Missile Systems Center (SMC) at Los Angeles Air Force Base '
         'awarded Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) a $240 million contract to '
         'develop a prototype payload for its new Protected Tactical SATCOM '
         '(PTS) system. PTS is a next-generation capability connecting '
         'warfighters with more agile and jam-resistant satellite '
         'communications (SATCOM). The complete system will deploy a '
         'constellation of dedicated geostationary satellites, commercially '
         'hosted payloads, and coalition partner satellites integrated through '
         'a ground control network to provide U.S. and coalition forces '
         'protected communications in a data hungry battlespace. SMC’s '
         'acquisition begins with a rapid prototyping phase for a new mission '
         'payload hosting the Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW). The '
         'fully-processed payloads will ensure adaptive, anti-jamming '
         'communications channels are available to allied forces in a '
         'contested environment. SMC is leveraging Other Transaction Authority '
         '(OTA) contracting mechanisms rather than a traditional Federal '
         'Acquisition Regulation (FAR)-based acquisition for prototyping to '
         'provide agile development, “E.P.I.C. Speed,” and an avenue for '
         'non-traditional participation. E.P.I.C. Speed is SMC’s acronym for '
         'Enterprise, Partnership, Innovation, Culture and Speed. Lockheed '
         'Martin is excited to be in a position to rapidly develop protected '
         'SATCOM payload technologies that will benefit the warfighter. '
         '“Teaming with non-traditional hardware and software developers has '
         'enabled the Lockheed Martin team to leap frog communications payload '
         'capabilities,” said Erik Daehler, Lockheed Martin’s director of '
         'Strategic Communications Architectures. “We are able to ‘Go Fast,’ '
         'both in technology deployment and contracting structure, due to the '
         'nature of the OTA acquisition. Our partnership with the Space '
         'Enterprise Consortium (SpEC) has made these non-traditional '
         'acquisitions possible.” “Lockheed Martin understands how important '
         'protected communications are to our tactical warfighters deployed '
         'downrange. We also know that our SATCOM systems have to evolve to '
         'stay ahead of the threats, because a space system that can’t survive '
         'Day 1 of a conflict can’t achieve the mission,” said Mike Cacheiro, '
         'Lockheed Martin’s vice president for Protected Military SATCOM. '
         '“Having delivered the nation’s essential satellite communications '
         'systems, we are uniquely positioned to partner with the U.S. Space '
         'Force to develop the next generation’s innovative, resilient and '
         'modular protected tactical SATCOM architecture.” Lockheed Martin '
         'launched the first commercial protected communications payload on '
         'Hellas Sat-4/SaudiGeoSat-1 (HS-4/SGS-1) in 2019, featuring the most '
         'advanced digital signal processor and protected communications '
         'algorithms available. These technologies along with mission '
         'expertise and a partnership with the Space Force will dramatically '
         'accelerate PTS to the warfighter. PTS continues Lockheed Martin’s '
         'legacy of developing resilient protected communications for the '
         'military that includes both the Advanced Extremely High Frequency '
         '(AEHF) and the MILSTAR systems. In 2015, the Air Force awarded the '
         'company a contract for Combined Orbital Operations Logistics '
         'Sustainment ( COOLS ), which cost-effectively consolidated the '
         'sustainment of the AEHF, MILSTAR and DSCS III constellations in one '
         'ground system. In 2019, the COOL\\R contract extended that '
         'sustainment emphasizing additional resiliency, cyber and mission '
         'planning enhancements. Lockheed Martin has developed and built more '
         'than 300 payloads for a variety of missions. The company has more '
         'than 50 years of experience as a payload integrator, developing '
         'cutting-edge technologies supporting our nation’s critical missions. '

         'constellation to ensure U.S. and allied forces always have the best '
         'technology and that the U.S. Global Positioning System remains the '
         'gold standard for PNT." GPS III is the most powerful and resilient '
         'GPS satellite ever put on orbit. Developed with an entirely new '
         'design for U.S. and allied forces, GPS III has three times greater '
         'accuracy and up to eight times improved anti-jamming capabilities '
         'over any previous GPS satellites in the constellation. GPS III is '
         'also the first GPS satellite to broadcast the new L1C civil signal, '
         'which is shared by other international global navigation satellite '
         'systems, like Galileo, to improve future connectivity worldwide for '
         'commercial and civilian users. GPS III was intentionally designed to '
         'evolve with new technology and changing mission needs. The '
         'satellite\'s evolutionary modular design will allow new " GPS IIIF " '
         'capabilities to start being added at the 11 th satellite. These will '
         'include a fully digital navigation payload, a Regional Military '
         'Protection capability, an accuracy-enhancing Laser Retroreflector '
         'Array, and a Search & Rescue payload. Meanwhile, GPS III satellites '
         'are beginning to join the constellation. On Jan. 13, 2020 , the '
         'first Lockheed Martin-built GPS III satellite, GPS III SV01 '
         '("Vespucci"), was set " healthy and active " by the 2 nd Space '
         'Operations Squadron (2 SOPS) at Schriever Air Force Base, in '
         'Colorado . 2 SOPS is now using\xa0the GPS III Contingency Operations '
         '(COps) -upgraded OCS ground control system to operate both the new '
         'GPS III and previously launched GPS satellites. GPS III SV02 '
         '("Magellan"), launched on Aug. 22, 2019 , has completed its on-orbit '
         'testing and is currently awaiting its turn for integration into the '
         'constellation. GPS III SV03 has now been shipped to the Cape and on '
         'Jan. 21, 2020 , the Space Force called up GPS III SV04 for a launch '
         'later this summer. GPS III SV05-09 are now in various stages of '
         "assembly and test at Lockheed Martin's commercial-like large "
         'satellite production line for GPS III satellites near Denver . The '
         'company is expected to soon complete its critical design review with '
         'the Space Force to begin production on the first two GPS IIIF '
         'satellites under contract. "It\'s an exciting time across the GPS '
         'mission as we bring together the best of our space, ground, and '
         'operations systems to help the United States Space Force modernize '
         'this critical national capability," commented Johnathon Caldwell , '
         "Lockheed Martin's vice president for Navigation Systems. Lockheed "
         "Martin is proud to be a part of the U.S. Space Force's GPS III team. "
         'The GPS III team is led by the Production Corps, Medium Earth Orbit '
         "Division, at the Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center, at "
         'Los Angeles Air Force Base. 2 SOPS, at Schriever Air Force Base, '

         'christening brings the USS Cooperstown one step closer to joining a '

         'capability in anti-submarine, surface and mine countermeasure '

         'environment. As we see an increase in near-peer competition from '
         'large nation states, Lockheed Martin is partnering with the Navy to '
         'evolve LCS to meet these threats. Targeted upgrades are already '
         'underway with naval strike missiles being installed in support of '
         'upcoming deployments. Future installs of improved electronic warfare '

 'text': 'ANAHEIM, Calif., Jan. 28, 2020 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company '
         '(NYSE: LMT), announced today it is accepting position agreements for '
         'upgrades to the best-in-class S-92 helicopter: the S-92A+™ and the '
         'S-92B™ helicopters. The announcement at the annual Helicopter '
         'Association International (HAI) Heli Expo demonstrates continued '
         'investment in and commitment to commercial helicopter operators and '
         'customers. “We are excited to offer these upgrades in response to '
         'market demands and introduce technologies, enhanced reliability and '
         'improved economics,” said Sikorsky Commercial Systems and Services '
         'Vice President Audrey Brady. “The upgrades will help customers with '
         'operating cost reductions, deliver increased capability with 20 '
         'percent more payload and a new engine option.” The S-92A+™ upgrade '
         'kit and newly-produced S-92B™ aircraft share a nearly identical '
         'configuration. The S-92B features 20 percent enlarged cabin windows '
         'with plans for an Offshore and Search & Rescue (SAR) common cabin '
         'configuration. General Electric’s CT7-8A6 engine, capable of '
         'producing more power in higher altitudes and hotter temperatures, '
         'will also be available as an option for both the S-92A+ and S-92B. '
         'Fleet updates include the introduction of phase one MATRIX™ '
         'technology, bringing advanced computing power to the S-92, enabling '
         'the adoption of autonomous landing technology such as Rig Approach™ '
         '2.0 and a new technology from Sikorsky Innovations, SuperSearch™, '
         'which uses advanced algorithms to locate objects up to 30 percent '
         'faster enhancing safety. The S-92A+™ upgrade kit includes weight '
         'reduction features and 27,700 lb. Max Gross Weight with LifePlus™ to '
         'improve component retirement times.\xa0 Additional priced options '
         'are also available. The S-92A+™ kit and new-production S-92B™ will '
         'feature the revolutionary Phase IV Main Gear Box which has been '
         'validated to exceed CFR 29.927(c) requirements, as demonstrated by '
         'full-scale testing and witnessed by the Federal Aviation '
         'Administration. All primary lubrication system oil was removed prior '
         'to operating the gearbox for the equivalent of 500+ nautical miles '
         'in flight at 80 knots airspeed with no discernable anomalies during '
         'post-test examinations. Sikorsky is now accepting position '
         'agreements to align customers for future orders and allow the '
         'marketspace to demonstrate its reciprocal commitment to the '
         'technological advances included in the S-92A+ and S-92B offerings. '

         'share 2 $23.65 - $23.95 Cash from operations ≥$7,600 1 The net '
         'FAS/CAS pension adjustment above is presented as a single amount and '
         'includes total expected 2020 U.S. Government cost accounting '
         'standards (CAS) pension cost of approximately $1,975 million and '
         'total expected financial accounting standards (FAS) pension income '
         'of approximately $115 million. CAS pension cost and the service cost '
         'component of FAS pension expense is included in operating profit. '
         'The non-service cost components of FAS pension expense are included '
         'in non-operating income (expense). For additional detail on the '
         "corporation's FAS/CAS pension adjustment see the supplemental table "
         'included at the end of this news release. 2 Although the corporation '
         'typically does not update its outlook for proposed changes in law, '
         'the above includes the effect of proposed tax regulations confirming '
         'that foreign military sales (FMS) qualify for tax deductions for '
         'foreign derived intangible income.\xa0The corporation believes '
         'incorporating the effect of the proposed regulations more accurately '
         'reflects its expectations because the proposed regulations describe '
         "the tax treatment of FMS sales in accordance with the corporation's "
         "analysis of the Internal Revenue Code. 3 The corporation's financial "
         'outlook for 2020 does not include potential impacts to the '
         "corporation's programs, including the F-35 program, resulting from "
         'U.S. Government actions related to Turkey. Currently, the '
         'corporation does not expect this event will have a material impact '
         'on its 2020 financial results. The corporation expects the 2020 net '
         'FAS/CAS pension benefit to be approximately $2.1 billion based on a '
         '3.25 percent discount rate (a 100\xa0basis point decrease from the '
         'end of 2018), an approximate 21 percent return on plan assets in '
         '2019, a 7.0 percent expected long-term rate of return on plan assets '
         'in future years (unchanged from the end of 2018), and the revised '
         'longevity assumptions released during the fourth quarter of 2019 by '
         'the Society of Actuaries. As a result of the $1.0 billion in '
         'contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in '
         '2019, the corporation does not expect to make contributions to its '
         'qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2020. The corporation '
         'projects FAS pension income in 2020, compared to FAS pension expense '
         'in 2019, as a result of completing the planned freeze of its '
         'salaried pension plans effective Jan. 1, 2020 that was previously '
         "announced on July 1, 2014 . The corporation's FAS pension expense is "
         'comprised of service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan '
         'assets, amortization of prior service credit, and amortization of '
         'actuarial losses. The service cost and amortization of actuarial '
         'losses components of FAS pension expense are significantly lower due '
         'to the freeze. As a result, the expected return on plan assets and '
         'amortization of prior service credit exceed all other FAS pension '
         'expense components in 2020. For additional information regarding the '
         "corporation's FAS pension expense or income and CAS pension cost, "
         "see the corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended "
         "Dec. 31, 2018 . Cash Activities The corporation's cash activities in "

         'actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from '
         'significant divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate '

         'and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension cost in each of its business '
         "segments' net sales and cost of sales. The corporation's "

         'postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with '
         'U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as FAS '
         'expense). The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension '
         'adjustment represents the difference between the service cost '
         'component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. The '
         'non-service FAS pension expense component is included in other '
         "non‑operating expense on the corporation's consolidated statements "
         'of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases or '
         'decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense (both '
         'service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating profit '
         'generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer '
         'to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting '
         'from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service '
         'levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating '
         'profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a '
         "particular contract. In addition, comparability of the corporation's "
         'segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted '
         'favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the '
         "corporation's contracts for which it recognizes revenue over time "
         'using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure '
         'progress towards completion. Increases in profit booking rates, '
         'typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to '
         'revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance '
         'obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular '
         'contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may '
         'deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs '
         'to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit '
         'booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are '
         'recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date '
         'effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also '
         'be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or '
         'may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive '
         'resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and '
         'restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of '
         'assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of '

 'text': 'MARIETTA, Ga., Feb. 7, 2020 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) delivered '
         'the second of two KC-130J Super Hercules aerial refuelers to '
         "representatives from France’s Armée de l'Air on Feb. 4, at the "
         'company’s Aeronautics facility in Marietta, Georgia. France has '
         'received a total of four Super Hercules aircraft — two C-130J-30 '
         'combat delivery airlifters and two KC-130J aerial refuelers — '
         'through a Foreign Military Sale with the U.S. government. The two '
         'C-130J-30 airlifters were delivered in 2017 and 2018, and first '
         'KC-130J delivered in September 2019. All of these Super Hercules are '
         'operated in conjunction with France’s existing C-130H fleet. '
         '“France’s C-130 crews have long demonstrated the unmatched and '
         'proven performance of the Hercules aircraft in support of critical '
         'missions,” said Rod McLean, vice president and general manager, Air '
         'Mobility & Maritime Missions at Lockheed Martin. “This additional '
         'KC-130J expands the Armée de l‘Air’s already robust airlift and '
         'refueling resources to not only serve as a national asset, but a '
         'global resource as well.” France is the 17th country to choose the '
         'C-130J for its airlift and refueling needs. The C-130J Super '
         'Hercules is the most advanced tactical airlifter in operation today, '
         'offering superior performance and enhanced capabilities with the '
         'range and versatility for every theater of operations and evolving '
         'requirements. As the preeminent tactical aerial refueling tanker, '
         'the KC-130J is a battle-tested solution that takes full advantage of '
         'the tremendous technological and performance improvements inherent '
         'in the C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. A true force multiplier, the '
         'KC-130J refuels both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft as well as '
         'conducts rapid ground refueling. With this delivery, France joins a '
         'global community of KC-130J operators. In 2018, Germany announced '
         'the acquisition of a C-130J-30/KC-130J fleet, to be operated in '
         'partnership with France — making this the first operator '
         'relationship of this type in C-130J history. The C-130J Super '
         'Hercules is the global standard in tactical airlift, providing a '
         'unique mix of versatility and performance to complete any mission — '
         'anytime, anywhere. The Super Hercules worldwide fleet has more than '
         '2 million flight hours and is the airlifter of choice for 20 '
         'nations. For additional information, visit '

         'F-35s were integrated with the U.S. Army Integrated Air and Missile '
         'Defense Battle Command System (IBCS), providing an airborne sensor '
         'capability to successfully detect, track and intercept near '
         'simultaneous air-breathing threats in a test at White Sands Missile '
         'Range, New Mexico. The December 2019 test marked the first time '
         'F-35s were used as sensors during an IBCS live fire test against '
         'multiple airborne targets. Linking F-35s to IBCS via the '
         'Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) provided enhanced '
         'situational awareness and weapons-quality track data to engage '
         'airborne targets. The proof of concept demonstration used '
         'experimental equipment developed by Lockheed Martin, including the '
         'Harvest Lightning Ground Station and IBCS adaptation kit (A-Kit). '
         '“The F-35’s advanced sensors and connectivity enable it to gather, '
         'analyze and seamlessly share critical information with the joint '
         'fighting force to lead the multi-domain battlespace,” said Greg '
         'Ulmer, Lockheed Martin vice president and general manager of the '
         'F-35 program. “This test validated the F-35’s capability to serve as '
         'an airborne sensor and extend the range of critical Integrated Air '
         'and Missile Defense interceptors.” “This test represents a major '
         'milestone for multi-domain operations by leveraging airborne assets '
         'to detect and track threats that can then be countered with '
         'ground-based effectors. This demonstrates a tremendous capability to '
         'defeat threats that are terrain masked or beyond ground-based sensor '
         'detection capabilities due to terrain and curvature of the earth,” '
         'said Jay Pitman, vice president, Lower Tier Integrated Air and '

 'text': 'ANAHEIM, California, Jan. 28, 2020 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin '
         'company (NYSE: LMT) today recognized and thanked the County of Los '
         'Angeles Fire Department, the City of San Diego Fire-Rescue and the '
         'State of California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection '
         '(CAL FIRE) for their commitment to aerial fire-fighting operations '
         'with the S-70i™ Firehawk ® helicopter. Each of the three fire '
         'services recently took delivery of the new-generation aircraft for '
         'wildland firefighting, search and rescue and medical transport. The '
         'LACoFD aircraft is prominently displayed here in Sikorsky’s expo '
         'booth at this week’s 2020 Helicopter Association International '
         'Heli-Expo, where San Diego and CAL FIRE’s aircraft also are on the '
         'exhibit floor. “At hundreds of brush fires and medical rescues, the '
         'Sikorsky Firehawk has proven to simply be the best all-in-one aerial '
         'firefighting weapon,” said Los Angeles County Fire Department Fire '
         'Chief Daryl L. Osby. “We can carry more firefighters to the fire '
         'line, and repeatedly support them by dropping thousands of gallons '
         'of water with precision and with a fast turnaround. And we can '
         'perform hoist rescues at close to 10,000 feet altitude, as well as '
         'provide critical paramedic service at municipal and extremely remote '
         'locations. It took courage for Sikorsky to stick with us as they did '
         'in the early 2000s when we tested and adapted the aerial fire-rescue '
         'tactics of the first variant. LA County along with Sikorsky Firehawk '
         'helicopters have led the way and will continue to lead the way '
         'always looking to provide the public with the service they deserve '
         'and expect. But look where we are now — the state of California and '
         'other municipalities are going to derive benefits from years of '
         'pioneering work.” Compared to LACoFD’s three S-70A FIREHAWK '
         'aircraft, the new-generation S-70i model brings more power, greater '
         'maneuverability and lift capabilities, as well as enhanced flight '
         'safety. Systems integrator United Rotorcraft, a division of Air '
         'Methods, configured the three aircraft with an extended landing gear '
         'and a 1,000-gallon (3,785 liter) belly water tank manufactured by '
         'Kawak Aviation Technologies. “We thank the State of California, Los '
         'Angeles County and the City of San Diego for their collective trust '
         'in the men and women of Sikorsky Aircraft, who strongly believe, as '
         'did our founder Igor Sikorsky, that helicopters should serve '
         'humankind,” said Jeanette Eaton, Sikorsky Regional Executive for '
         'North America. “As these first three new-generation Firehawk '
         'helicopters are placed into service to preserve lives and property, '
         'Sikorsky is putting in place programs to support California’s '
         'firefighters with world-class logistics and technical support that '
         'will ensure flight readiness for decades to come.” CAL FIRE, which '
         'operates the world’s largest aerial firefighting fleet, intends to '
         'deploy a total of 12 S-70i FIREHAWK helicopters across the state '
         'following deliveries by Sikorsky and United Rotorcraft over the next '
         'four years. LACoFD also will receive its second of two aircraft this '
         'year. For more information, see www.lockheedmartin.com/firehawk '

 'text': 'ANAHEIM, Calif., Jan. 28, 2020 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company '
         '(NYSE: LMT), today recognized Bristow, CHC, and Cougar Helicopters '
         'for their life-saving mission capability using the workhorse S-92® '
         'Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopter. Audrey Brady, Sikorsky VP, '
         'Commercial Systems and Services and Sergei Sikorsky, son of company '
         'founder Igor Sikorsky, thanked Bristow, CHC, and Cougar executives '
         'in a ceremony at the 2020 Helicopter Association International '
         'Heli-Expo here. In 2019, Bristow, CHC, and Cougar were responsible '
         'for a total of more than 2,700 SAR missions resulting in more than '
         '1,700 lives saved. Bristow operates the aircraft for the U.K. '
         'Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) for Her Majesty’s Coastguard. '
         'The S-92 was involved in almost 65 percent of its sorties in 2019; '
         '72 percent of all people rescued by Coastguard aircraft were saved '
         'by crews operating a Sikorsky S-92. In addition, Bristow Americas '
         'completed 26 SAR sorties using the S-92 in the Gulf of Mexico. In '
         'Norway, Bristow used the S-92 for all SAR and Medevac missions in '
         '2019. In total, 62 SAR and ambulance flights were performed in the '
         'Ekofisk area as well as the Barents Sea. CHC SAR operations '
         'experience extremely high dispatch availability rates; the Irish '
         'Coast Guard currently flies at nearly 98 percent reliability.\xa0 '
         'One of CHC’s most notable rescues of the year lasted into the early '
         'morning hours of March 24, after a large cruise ship off the coast '
         'of Norway experienced an engine failure. Three S-92 aircraft were '
         'involved in the rescue mission, and 466 people were safely rescued. '
         'To date, this is the largest helicopter rescue at sea. “The '
         'recognition for our SAR missions belongs to our pilots, flight '
         'crews, mechanics and all the other team members that work tirelessly '
         'to ensure safe and reliable transport and dispatch reliability,” '
         'said Miguel Carrasco, CHC’s senior vice president, Operations and '
         'Supply Chain. “I am honored to accept the award on behalf of the '
         'great team at CHC.” Cougar Helicopters, the first rotorcraft company '
         'in North America to utilize the S-92 in a SAR capacity, flew more '
         'than 350 SAR sorties this year, totaling nearly 570 flight hours. '
         'Cougar has been the recipient of 35 Sikorsky Winged-S Rescue Awards '
         'since 2008 and boasts a 20-minute SAR response time in the '
         'northeastern Atlantic. The Sikorsky S-92 has flown more than 1.6 '
         'million total flight hours, predominantly for civil search and '
         'rescue operations and for operators serving the worldwide offshore '
         'oil and gas industry. The S-92 currently operates in 25 countries '
         'and is the industry standard for safety and reliability. Thirteen '
         'nations, including the U.S., have selected the S-92 helicopter for '

 'text': 'Koblenz/Bonn, 13.01.2020 – Sikorsky, ein Unternehmen von Lockheed '
         'Martin, und Rheinmetall haben am 13. Januar 2020 ihr Angebot für die '
         'Fertigung und den Betrieb der Sikorsky CH-53K als neuen schweren '
         'Transporthubschrauber (STH) der Bundeswehr eingereicht. Für das '
         'Projekt haben der US-Hubschrauberhersteller Sikorsky und der '
         'deutsche Technologiekonzern Rheinmetall frühzeitig ein Kernteam '
         'gebildet, zu dem die namhaften deutschen Industrieunternehmen MTU '
         'Aero Engines, Autoflug GmbH sowie Hydro Systems KG zählen. „Das '
         'gesamte Team freut sich, ein Angebot für den effizientesten und '
         'leistungsfähigsten Transporthubschrauber mit dem besten Langzeitwert '
         'für die Bundeswehr abgeben zu können“, sagte Beth Parcella, CH-53K '
         'International Business Development Director. „Wir werden im weiteren '
         'Verlauf die Details unseres STH Angebots im engen Dialog mit dem '
         'BAAINBw abstimmen“, so Parcella. „Durch den frühzeitigen Aufbau '
         'eines deutschen Industrieteams und die Expertise unserer Partner '
         'können wir die Qualität des Angebots und im Anschluss die hohe '
         'Verfügbarkeit der CH-53K im Dienst der Bundeswehr sichern.“ Mike '
         'Schmidt, Geschäftsführer der Rheinmetall Aviation Services GmbH: '
         '„Deutsche Unternehmen werden einen erheblichen Anteil am Erfolg des '
         'CH-53K-Programms haben. Das bedeutet für die Industrie die Schaffung '
         'vieler neuer, langfristiger Arbeitsplätze für hochqualifizierte '
         'Mitarbeiter und einen wichtigen Know-how-Transfer“, sagte Schmidt in '
         'Bonn. „Sikorsky und Rheinmetall haben die Bewerbung über einen '
         'langen Zeitraum gemeinsam vorbereitet – das hat uns als Partner eng '
         'zusammengeschweißt. Wir sind zu einem sehr leistungsfähigen Team '
         'zusammengewachsen!“, so Schmidt. Betrachtet man die '
         'Lebenszykluskosten sowie Missionsanforderungen und -fähigkeiten, '
         'liefert die CH-53K den deutlich besseren Langzeitwert im Vergleich '
         'zu anderen Transporthubschraubern. Die Avionik und das '
         'digitalisierte Flugsteuerungssystem bieten Aufwuchspotential für die '
         'Integration weiterer Systeme und auch die Nutzlastfähigkeit kann mit '
         'relativ einfachen Modifikationen erheblich gesteigert werden. Ein '
         'integriertes Sensor- und Diagnosesystem ermöglicht es dem '
         'Hubschrauber, Probleme frühzeitig zu erkennen und einzugrenzen, was '
         'den Wartungsaufwand drastisch vereinfacht und ausschlaggebend für '
         'eine hohe Verfügbarkeit und den effizienten Betrieb der gesamten '
         'Flotte ist. Ein weiterer Vorteil der CH-53K ist die Fähigkeit zur '
         'Luftbetankung sowie volle Interoperabilität mit dem '
         'Betankungsflugzeug KC-130J von Lockheed Martin, dessen Beschaffung '
         'die Bundeswehr plant und das von Frankreich bereits eingesetzt wird. '
         'Aufgrund der Auslegung des Laderaums ist die CH-53K zudem fähig, die '
         'gleichen Lufttransportpaletten wie die C-130J und der A400M '
         'aufzunehmen und so einen schnellen Ladungsumschlag zu ermöglichen. '
         'Damit kann der Hubschrauber an Orten eingesetzt werden, wo diese '
         'Transportflugzeuge aufgrund ihrer Größe nicht mehr landen können. '
         'Durch seine Vielseitigkeit ist dieser Transporthubschrauber für den '
         'taktischen Transport von Personal und Material, humanitäre Einsätze, '
         'medizinische Evakuierungs- oder bewaffnete Such- und '
         'Rettungsmissionen (CSAR) sowie im Katastrophenschutz einsetzbar. '
         'Besonders geeignet ist die CH-53K bei der zunehmend wichtigen '
         'Brandbekämpfung aus der Luft, da kein anderer verfügbarer '
         'Hubschrauber mehr Löschwasser, Material und Personal in '
         'Einsatzgebiete transportieren kann. Im Falle einer erfolgreichen '
         'Bewerbung wollen Sikorsky und Rheinmetall am Flughafen Leipzig/Halle '
         'ein Logistikzentrum sowie ein STH-Flotten-Unterstützungszentrum '
         'aufbauen. Wie die beiden Unternehmen bereits Ende Oktober 2019 '
         'ankündigten, befinden sie sich dazu in fortgeschrittenen Gesprächen '
         'mit Vertretern der Landespolitik, den dort bereits ansässigen '
         'Unternehmen sowie dem Flughafenbetreiber. Hintergrund: Mit der '
         'Abgabe des Angebots beginnt die nächste Phase im '
         'Ausschreibungsprozess um den „Schweren Transporthubschrauber“ (STH). '
         'Das Angebot bildet die Grundlage für die Verhandlungen mit dem '
         'Bundesamt für Ausrüstung, Informationstechnik und Nutzung der '
         'Bundeswehr (BAAINBw). Die Abgabe eines finalen Angebots ist für Ende '
         '2020 geplant. Die endgültige Entscheidung über die Vergabe des neuen '
         'Transporthubschraubers soll Anfang 2021 getroffen werden. Die erste '
         'Auslieferung der Luftfahrzeuge könnte dann wie gefordert ab 2024 '
         'erfolgen, um den nahtlosen Übergang von der aktuellen CH-53G Flotte '
         'zu ermöglichen, das entsprechende Personal auszubilden und die '
         'logistischen Grundlagen für den Betrieb in Deutschland zu schaffen. '
         'ÜBER LOCKHEED MARTIN Lockheed Martin ist ein weltweit tätiges '

         'a $1.9 billion contract to support operations and sustainment of the '
         'global F-35 fleet, while improving mission readiness and further '
         'reducing costs. The annual contract funds critical sustainment '
         'activities for aircraft currently in the fleet and builds enterprise '
         'capacity to support the future fleet of more than 3,000 F-35 '
         'aircraft. This includes industry sustainment experts supporting base '
         'and depot maintenance, pilot and maintainer training, and sustaining '
         'engineering across the globe. It also covers fleet-wide data '
         'analytics and supply chain management for part repair and '
         'replenishment to enhance overall supply availability for the fleet. '
         '"The F-35 continues to deliver exceptional capabilities to the '

 'text': 'DENVER , Dec. 13, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- The capsule-shaped '
         "aeroshell that will protect NASA's Mars 2020 rover was delivered to "
         "NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida . yesterday. Built by Lockheed "
         'Martin [NYSE: LMT], the aeroshell will encapsulate and protect the '
         'Mars 2020 rover during its deep space cruise to Mars, and from the '
         'intense heat as the entry system descends through the Martian '
         'atmosphere to the surface of Mars. Because of the large mass and '
         'unique entry trajectory profile that could create external '
         'temperatures up to 3,800 degrees Fahrenheit, the heat shield uses a '
         'tiled Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) thermal protection '
         'system instead of the Mars heritage Super Lightweight Ablator (SLA) '
         '561V. This will only be the second time PICA has flown on a Mars '
         'mission. "Even though we have the experience of building the nearly '
         'identical aeroshell for the Curiosity Rover, the almost 15-foot '
         'diameter composite structure was just as big a challenge to build '
         'and test 10 years later," said Neil Tice , Mars 2020 aeroshell '
         'program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. "We\'ve built every Mars '
         'aeroshell entry system for NASA of its 40 years of exploring Mars, '
         'so we pulled from that experience to build this important system." '
         'Along with the Curiosity mission, this is the largest aeroshell/heat '
         'shield ever built for a planetary mission at 4.5 meters (nearly 15 '
         'feet) in diameter. In contrast, the aeroshell/heat shield of the '
         'InSight lander measured 8.6 feet and Apollo capsule heat shields '
         'measured just less than 13 feet. The backshell and heat shield were '
         "transported from Lockheed Martin's Waterton facility in Littleton, "
         'Colorado where they were built, to nearby Buckley Air Force Base. '
         'They were then loaded onto an Air Force transport plane and flown to '
         "NASA's Kennedy Space Center . Recently, Lockheed Martin integrated "
         'the MSL Entry Descent and Landing Instrument ( MEDLI2 ) onto the '
         "heat shield and backshell. Provided by NASA's Langley and Ames "
         'Research Centers, MEDLI2 will collect temperature and pressure data '
         "during the spacecraft's descent through the Martian atmosphere. The "
         "Mars 2020 rover is in testing at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, "
         'Pasadena, California ., which manages the Mars 2020 project for the '
         'NASA Science Mission Directorate, Washington . The mission will '
         'launch in July 2020 and land on Mars in February 2021 at the Jezero '

         'Ship (LCS) 19, the future USS St. Louis, completed Acceptance Trials '
         'in Lake Michigan . Now that trials are complete, the ship will '
         'undergo final outfitting and fine-tuning before delivery. LCS 19 is '
         'the tenth Freedom-variant LCS designed and built by the Lockheed '
         'Martin (NYSE: LMT)-led industry team and is slated for delivery to '
         'the Navy early next year. "The LCS fleet is growing in numbers and '
         "capability, and LCS 19's completion of acceptance trials means the "
         'Navy will shortly have 10 Freedom-variant fast, focused-mission '
         'ships in the fleet," said Joe DePietro , Lockheed Martin vice '
         'president and general manager, Small Combatants and Ship Systems. '
         '"As each Freedom-variant hull deploys, we seek out and incorporate '
         'fleet feedback and lessons learned to roll in capabilities for new '
         'hulls. As a result, LCS 19 includes a solid-state radar, upgraded '
         'communications suite, increased self-defense capabilities and '
         'topside optimization, among other updates." In total, there are more '
         'than 500,000 nautical miles under the keel of Freedom-variant LCS. '
         'The Freedom-variant LCS has completed three successful deployments '
         'with a fourth ongoing. In October, LCS 7 (USS Detroit) deployed to '
         'the U.S. Southern Command supporting the Martillo campaign – a '
         'multinational effort targeting illicit trafficking routes in Central '
         'American coastal waters. LCS is designed to deliver speed to '
         'capability and to grow as the missions it serves evolve. Today, the '
         'Freedom-variant LCS delivers advanced capability in anti-submarine, '
         'surface and mine countermeasure missions. The Freedom-variant LCS is '
         'targeted for warfighting upgrades to enhance situational awareness '
         "and evolve the ship's self-defense capabilities. These upgrades are "
         'already underway – LCS computing infrastructures are receiving cyber '
         'upgrades and over-the-horizon missiles are being installed in '
         'support of upcoming deployments. Unique among combat ships, the '
         'focused-mission LCS is designed to support mine countermeasures, '
         'anti-submarine and surface warfare missions and is easily adapted to '
         'serve future and evolving missions. The Freedom-variant LCS is: '

 'text': 'MOORESTOWN, N.J., January 14, 2020 – Through partnerships with the '
         'U.S. Government, Spain, Japan, and Canada, Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE: '
         'LMT) solid state radar (SSR) technology will provide front-line '
         'defense to nations around the world with cutting-edge air and '
         'missile defense capabilities.\xa0 These nations are part of a '
         'growing SSR family of 24 platforms, ushering in the next generation '
         'of maritime and ground-based advanced radar technology. The basis of '
         'SSR is the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), which the Missile '
         'Defense Agency (MDA) selected Lockheed Martin to develop in 2015 '
         'with an on-track delivery set for 2020.\xa0 In 2019 Lockheed '
         'Martin’s SSR for Aegis Ashore Japan was designated by the United '
         'States Government as AN/SPY-7(V)1. What is SSR Technology? SPY-7’s '
         'core technology is derived from the LRDR program, which has been '
         'declared Technical Readiness Level 7 by the U.S. Government. The '
         'technology consists of a scalable and modular gallium nitride (GaN) '
         'based “subarray” radar building block, providing advanced '
         'performance and increased efficiency and reliability to pace '
         'ever-evolving threats. \xa0As part of its investment into the '
         'advancement of SSR, Lockheed Martin built a Solid State Radar '
         'Integration Site to conduct detailed testing to prove the maturity '
         'of the system and reduce fielding risk.\xa0 Scaled versions of the '
         'LRDR site will be utilized for future radar programs including Aegis '
         'System Equipped Vessel (ASEV), Canadian Surface Combatant and MDA’s '
         'Homeland Defense Radar in Hawaii. Solid state offers powerful '
         'capabilities to detect, track and engage sophisticated air and '
         'missile threats, including the very complicated task of '
         'discriminating – or picking out – and countering lethal objects '
         'present in enemy ballistic missiles. The Lockheed Martin SSR uses '
         'state-of-the art hardware and an innovative software-defined radar '
         'architecture to meet current requirements while providing '
         'extensibility features to pace evolving threats for decades to '
         'come.\xa0 Its unique maintain-while-operate capability provides very '
         'high operational availability and enables continuous 24-hour/7-day '
         'week operation. Solid state radar is a multi-mission system '
         'providing a wide range of capabilities, from passive situational '
         'awareness to integrated air and missile defense solutions. The '
         'combined capability and mission flexibility of Lockheed Martin’s SSR '
         'has gained the attention of new and current users of the Aegis '
         'Weapon System, the world’s premier air and missile defense combat '
         'suite. Meeting the World’s Most Demanding Missions While LRDR is the '
         'first program to utilize Lockheed Martin’s new SSR building blocks, '
         'over the past three years Lockheed Martin has consistently been '
         'selected in open competitions to equip an additional 24 platforms in '
         'four nations. SPY-7 provides several times the performance of '
         'traditional SPY-1 radars and the ability to engage multiple targets '
         'simultaneously with the latest proven interceptors. Spain’s Ministry '
         'of Defense stated its preference for Lockheed Martin’s technology '
         'for its five F-110 class frigates in 2017 and awarded the ship '
         'construction order to Navantia in 2019. These ships will host the '
         'first-ever S-band variants of the SPY-7 radar for the Spanish Navy. '
         'Production will be a collaboration between Lockheed Martin and '
         'Spanish company, Indra. When the frigates deploy in 2026 our SPY-7 '
         'variant will be integrated as part of the Aegis Weapon System. The '
         'frigates will also incorporate the International Aegis Fire Control '
         'Loop (IAFCL) integrated with SCOMBA, the national combat system '
         'developed by Navantia. Canada’s Department of National Defence also '
         'selected Lockheed Martin as the naval radar provider for its 15 '
         'Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) ships. Lockheed Martin’s IAFCL is '
         'integrated with Canada’s combat management system, CMS 330, '
         'developed by Lockheed Martin Canada for the Royal Canadian Navy’s '
         'HALIFAX Class ships . The program will make Canada the owner of the '
         'world’s second largest Aegis fleet, and our SPY-7 radar variant will '
         'enable CSC to conduct highly advanced maritime missions for decades '
         'to come. Mature, Cost-Effective Systems Ready Now Including LRDR, '
         'the 24 Lockheed Martin SSR platforms selected to date represent a '
         'total of 91 antennas of varying sizes, collectively composed of over '
         '15,000 subarrays. On LRDR alone, Lockheed Martin has produced an '
         'equivalent of eight Aegis shipsets to-date. The U.S. Government’s '
         'LRDR has a planned service life for decades to come and will be '
         'supported and maintained throughout that period. This ensures the '
         'U.S. and its allies will have a large and stable base of '
         'cost-effective logistics and support for many years in the future.  '

 'text': 'ENGLEWOOD, Colorado, Dec. 9, 2019 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin '
         'company (NYSE: LMT), and United Rotorcraft, a division of Air '
         'Methods Corporation, announced today deliveries of three new S-70i™ '
         'FIREHAWK® helicopters to California fire agencies: one each to the '
         'Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), the Los '
         'Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD), and the City of San Diego '
         'Fire-Rescue Department. Configured by United Rotorcraft with a newly '
         'designed 1,000-gallon water tank attached to the belly of the '
         'aircraft; an extended landing gear to accommodate the tank; a '
         'retractable snorkel that can refill the tank in less than one '
         'minute; and a rescue hoist, the Firehawk helicopters will allow fire '
         'crews to attack wildfires, transport up to 12 ground firefighters to '
         'the fire line, and rescue firefighters and civilians when in need.  '
         '“We thank CAL FIRE, the County of Los Angeles and the City of San '
         'Diego for their trust in the combined efforts of Sikorsky and United '
         'Rotorcraft to bring a life-saving aerial firefighting helicopter to '
         'the urban centers and forests of California,” said Jason Lambert, '
         'vice president of Sikorsky Global Military & Mission Systems. “Their '
         'fire fighters now have a powerful and proven helicopter that can '
         'attack fires at night, in strong Santa Ana winds, maneuver with '
         'agility and safety in canyons and terrain from sea level up to '
         '10,000 ft. altitude, while dropping water with tremendous precision '
         'and force.” CAL FIRE’s newly acquired S-70i FIREHAWK helicopter is '
         'the first of nine aircraft currently on order, with an option for '
         'three more. CAL FIRE and San Diego are both first-time operators of '
         'the aerial firefighting helicopter. LACoFD has operated three S-70A '
         'model Firehawks since 2001. During the ensuing 19 years, the county '
         'has pioneered and perfected the tactics needed to suffocate '
         'wildfires in their early stage when a fire is most vulnerable, while '
         'working in close coordination with other aircraft and with '
         'firefighting crews on the ground. The county’s new S-70i FIREHAWK '
         'aircraft is the first of two — more powerful and faster than the '
         'S-70A model — that LACoFD is adding to its fleet. “With the increase '
         'in wildfire danger, the FIREHAWK has never been more relevant to the '
         'State of California,” said Mike Slattery, president of United '
         'Rotorcraft. “This capability brings unmatched multi-mission '
         'capability to these firefighting agencies to protect lives and '
         'property.” United Rotorcraft contracted with KAWAK Aviation '
         'Technologies (Bend, Oregon) to design and manufacture the water tank '
         'to new specifications based on input from LACoFD. Among other '
         'equipment on each aircraft are a 600 lb. external rescue hoist, a '
         '9,000 lb. cargo hook with load cell system, forward recognition '
         'lights and a high intensity searchlight. Avionics installations '
         'include tactical communications and navigation systems. A Firehawk '
         'begins life at Stratford-Connecticut-based Sikorsky as an S-70i '
         'Black Hawk helicopter. United Rotorcraft then converts the '
         'twin-engine aircraft to its aerial firefighting configuration. The '
         'aircraft retains its multi-mission capability, allowing aircrew to '
         'perform search and rescue missions, medical evacuation, and carry '
         'cargo either internally or as an external load. For more '

         'Rheinmetall Aviation Services GmbH: "German companies will play a '
         'significant role in the success of the CH-53K program. For the '
         'industry, this means the creation of many new, long-term jobs for '
         'highly qualified employees and an important transfer of know-how," '
         'he said. "Sikorsky and Rheinmetall prepared the application together '
         'over a long period of time - this has strengthened the bonds within '
         'our team. We have developed into a highly effective unit," Schmidt '
         'added. Looking at lifecycle costs, mission requirements and '
         'capability, the CH-53K will deliver better long-term value than its '
         'competitor. Its avionics and digitized flight control systems are '
         'designed to accommodate future software upgrades, and its internal '
         'payload capability may be increased substantially in the future with '
         'relatively simple modifications. An integrated sensor system enables '
         'the aircraft to predict and prevent problems at an early stage and '
         'thus drastically reduce the maintenance effort, which is a key '
         'element for high availability rates of the fleet. Additionally, the '
         'CH-53K is equipped with air-to-air refueling fully interoperable '
         "with Lockheed Martin's KC-130J tanker aircraft, which the Bundeswehr "
         'is planning to operate, and which is already being used by France. '
         'Due to the design of the cargo bay, the CH-53K easily accommodates '
         'the same air transport pallets, enabling fast cargo handling between '
         'it and fixed-wing transport aircrafts such as the C130-J and the '
         'A400M. This means that the helicopter can be used particularly in '
         'areas where these aircraft cannot land. Due to its versatility, the '
         'CH-53K can be used for the tactical transport of personnel and '
         'material as well as for disaster relief, humanitarian missions, '
         'medical evacuation (medevac) or combat search and rescue (CSAR) '
         'operations. For example, no other heavy-lift helicopter in the world '
         'can transport more water to fight fires and simultaneously carry '
         'material and personnel. The combination of high airspeed, a large '
         'water capacity and long mission endurance in operational areas '
         'allows the CH-53K to transport up to four times more water than its '
         'competitors. The CH-53K can move personnel and equipment more '
         'quickly, safely and effectively than any other helicopter -- meaning '
         'operators would not need as many aircraft to execute a mission. It '
         'will be safer and easier to operate, which will protect the pilots, '
         'the crew and the cargo, also providing value. The aircraft features '
         'fly-by-wire flight controls, reducing the pilots’ workload and '
         'allowing pilots to anticipate limits while keeping their eyes '
         'outside. This is a lifesaving capability in degraded conditions and '
         'allows precise control inputs when delivering an external load. If '
         'the bid is successful, Sikorsky and Rheinmetall intend to set up a '
         'logistics hub and a STH fleet support center at Leipzig/Halle '
         'Airport. The companies are in advanced talks with representatives of '
         'the state government, local companies and the airport operator. '

         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) LM-100J commercial freighter received its type '
         'design update certification from the Federal Aviation Administration '
         'on Nov. 15 . This particular FAA certification allows the LM-100J to '
         'operate from any commercial airfield in the world. In 2014, Lockheed '
         'Martin announced it would update its existing FAA A1SO type '
         'certificate for its Model L-382J aircraft to be marketed as the '
         'LM-100J, a civil-certified production variant of the military proven '
         'C-130J Super Hercules. The LM-100J is the modernized version of the '
         'Lockheed Martin L-100 freighter (Lockheed Model 382). More than 100 '
         'L-100s were produced from 1964-1992 at the then Lockheed-Georgia '
         'Co., facility in Marietta, Georgia , and many of these aircraft '
         'continue to support global operations today. "Like its military '
         'counterparts, the worldwide L-100 fleet is a much tasked and much '
         'relied upon. As this fleet reaches the end of its operating life, '
         'customers told us the only replacement for the L-100 is an LM-100J," '
         'said Rod McLean , vice president and general manager of Lockheed '
         'Martin\'s Air Mobility & Maritime Missions line of business. "This '
         'updated FAA certification enables the LM-100J to literally go '

         'enters into service, we are proud that it will continue to exemplify '
         'and expand the already unmatched capabilities of the C-130J Super '
         'Hercules family." Through select design changes, the LM-100J '
         'performs as a civil multi-purpose aircraft capable of rapid and '
         'efficient cargo transport and select specialized mission '
         'requirements. The LM-100J is an efficient and ideal airlift solution '
         'in delivering bulk and oversize cargo, particularly to austere '
         'locations around the world. The LM-100J incorporates technological '
         'developments and improvements over the existing legacy L-100 '
         'freighters that result from more than two decades of C-130J '
         'operational experience, including more than 2 million fleetwide '
         'flight hours flown by crews in 19 nations around the world. "We had '
         'the unique opportunity to design and build a completely new '
         'commercial airlifter with insights from a proven airframe," said '
         'Marilou Franklin , director of the LM-100J Program at Lockheed '
         'Martin. "Our goal was to produce an airlifter that was as safe as it '
         'was capable as it was advanced. In partnering with our existing '
         'L-100 operators, our network of suppliers and the FAA, we did that ― '
         'and more ― with the LM-100J." Notable operational LM-100J '
         'enhancements compared to a legacy L-100s include: In addition, the '

         '(NYSE: LMT), announced today the donation of its S-76® airframe to '
         'the American Helicopter Museum and Education Center. The airframe '
         'was delivered this week by employees from the Sikorsky Coatesville, '
         'Pa. facility, where it received a make-over into its original VIP '
         'customer configuration in preparation for its forever home. The '
         'airframe was created to be a realistic full-scale static display '
         'helicopter to showcase the S-76D™ model before its release. During '
         'its lifespan, the airframe has traveled across the globe on '
         'tradeshow assignments and had also been displayed at educational '
         'STEM events. Most recently, this S-76 wore a different outer skin '
         'and was shown as Sikorsky’s Autonomy Research Aircraft, nicknamed '
         'SARA. The helicopter helped educate people about Sikorsky’s autonomy '
         'capabilities and MATRIX™ Technology, which will allow future '
         'aircraft to operate with two, one or no pilots. Now that the S-76D '
         'helicopter has been in production for some time, the airframe will '
         'be put into a full-time educational role at the museum. “We are so '

 'text': 'MOORESTOWN , N.J., Dec. 5, 2019 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'recently signed a contract with Navantia to equip five new F-110 '
         'multimission frigates and their land-based test site (Centro de '
         'Integración de Sistemas en Tierra or CIST) – with Lockheed Martin’s '
         'first naval installation of its solid state S-band radar. The new '
         'F-110 frigates will be built by Spain’s national shipbuilder, '
         'Navantia. Recently designated by the U.S. Government as '
         'AN/SPY-7(V)1, this technology is derived from current radar programs '
         'and significant Lockheed Martin investment. Variants of the SPY-7 '
         'radar will also be utilized on programs with Japan’s Aegis Ashore , '
         'the Royal Canadian Navy for the Canadian Surface Combatant program '
         'and the U.S. Government. Why Does It Matter? Providing Spain’s '
         'homeland with a defense for evolving threats, the F-110 program will '
         'further protect the country and its citizens. Equipped with the '
         'latest digital, solid-state radar technology, this crucial program: '
         'What’s the Technology? The F-110 will host the first-ever naval '
         'solid state S-band radar for the Spanish Navy. To foster the growth '
         'of Spain’s defense and technology industries, Lockheed Martin and '
         'Spanish company, Indra, will jointly provide the radar. It will go '
         'to sea as part of the Aegis Weapon System, which will be integrated '
         'with the ship’s combat management system SCOMBA, when the first '
         'frigate deploys in 2026. The Aegis Weapon System is the most '
         'deployed combat system in the world, and its flexible system enables '
         'it to fulfill a variety of missions. Due in part to its unique open '
         'architecture design, the Aegis family continues to grow '
         'internationally as more nations around the world partner with '
         'Lockheed Martin. What’s the History? Lockheed Martin and its Spanish '
         'partners have over 20 years of experience in development, production '
         'and integration of tactical naval radar systems. Spain’s defense '
         'industry growth and expansion of their maritime defense portfolio is '
         'a mission Lockheed Martin continues to support. In the exciting '
         'future that lies ahead, Lockheed Martin will continue to work with '
         'Spanish industry to explore new areas of industrial cooperation in '
         'radar and combat system technologies. This will help pave the way '

         'reduction commitment one year earlier than planned." The sub $80 '
         'million unit recurring flyaway cost for an F-35 represents an '
         'integrated acquisition price for the 5 th Generation Weapon System. '

         'where the system successfully engaged and shot down multiple fixed '
         'wing and rotary drones. The Advanced Test High Energy Asset (ATHENA) '
         'operated in a fully-netted engagement environment with a government '
         'command and control (C2) system and radar sensor. The radar track '
         'was provided to airmen who operated ATHENA via cues from the C2, '
         "then ATHENA's beam director slewed, acquired, tracked and defeated "
         'the drone with a high-energy laser. Validating this type of full '
         'kill-chain performance has been a priority of the U.S. Air Force and '
         'other branches of the Department of Defense, and it remains a '
         'requirement for laser weapons to be effective against unmanned '
         'aerial systems (UAS) on the battlefield. "We\'ve watched in recent '

         'an affordable capability for the warfighter," said Sarah Reeves , '
         'vice president of Missile Defense Programs for Lockheed Martin. The '
         'ATHENA system was developed by Lockheed Martin to integrate '
         'seamlessly and provide a cost-effective, complementary anti-drone '
         'capability with the network of systems the warfighter is already '

         'demonstration, and it was able to destroy multiple drones in '
         'engagements representative of what is being encountered by U.S. '
         'armed forces today. The ATHENA high-energy laser system is '

 'text': 'Leipzig, 29.10.2019 - Gemeinsam mit einem Team führender deutscher '
         'Industrieunternehmen bewerben sich Sikorsky, ein Unternehmen von '
         'Lockheed Martin, und Rheinmetall mit dem Helikopter CH-53K (auch '
         '„King Stallion“ genannt) um die Nachfolge im Beschaffungsprojekt '
         '„Schwerer Transport\xadhubschrauber“ (STH). Im Falle einer '
         'erfolgreichen Bewerbung wollen das US-amerikanische Unternehmen und '
         'der deutsche Rüstungskonzern am Flughafen Leipzig/Halle ein '
         'Logistikzentrum sowie ein Fleet-Management-Center aufbauen. Dies '
         'würde die Ansiedlung zahlreicher Arbeitsplätze bedeuten sowie den '
         'Wirtschaftsstandort Leipzig und den hiesigen Flughafen erheblich '
         'stärken. Die Bundeswehr will Anfang 2021 über die Vergabe des neuen '
         'Transporthubschraubers entscheiden. Über ihre Absicht, das für den '
         'Betrieb des Hubschraubers notwendige Zentrum in Leipzig errichten zu '
         'wollen, informierten Rheinmetall und der renommierte '
         'US-Hubschrauberhersteller Sikorsky bereits Vertreter der '
         'Landespolitik, der Wirtschaftsförderung Sachsen sowie des '
         'Flughafenbetreibers. Mike Schmidt, Geschäftsführer Rheinmetall '
         'Aviation Services GmbH: „Wir befinden uns in fortgeschrittenen '
         'Gesprächen zu einem Logistik- und Projektsteuerungs-Hub am Leipziger '
         'Flughafen. Wir freuen uns über die bislang sehr positive Resonanz. '
         'Im Falle einer erfolgreichen Bewerbung könnte in Leipzig die '
         'Versorgung des neuen Bundeswehr-Transporthubschraubers sowie die '
         'Projektsteuerung zentral und effizient durchgeführt werden. Auch '
         'denken wir bei der Rheinmetall Aviation Services darüber nach, den '
         'Firmensitz nach Leipzig zu verlegen. Für die Region würde das '
         'Projekt eine Ansiedlung wichtiger Industrie und damit verbundener '
         'Arbeitsplätze bedeuten.“ Christian Albrecht, International Business '
         'Development Manager bei Sikorsky und ehemaliger Hauptmann beim '
         'Hubschraubergeschwader 64 in Holzdorf, ergänzte: „Wir haben in '
         'Deutschland ein starkes Industrieteam aufgebaut, das die '
         'Verfügbarkeit der CH-53K-Flotte für die Luftwaffe sicherstellen '
         'wird. 70 Prozent der Wartungsarbeiten sollen in Deutschland '
         'stattfinden. Mit unseren Plänen für einen Hub am Leipziger Flughafen '
         'legen wir den Grundstein, um der Bundeswehr einen über mehrere '
         'Jahrzehnte zuverlässigen Hubschrauber anbieten zu können.“ Neben der '
         'Nutzung existierender Hangars und Lagerflächen am Flughafen '
         'Leipzig/Halle sehen die Pläne von Sikorsky und Rheinmetall die '
         'Unterbringung eines Flotten-Management-Zentrums vor, in dem '
         'technische Daten der Hubschrauber ausgewertet werden können. Der '
         'CH-53K ist der modernste, intelligenteste und leistungsfähigste '
         'schwere Transporthubschrauber, der je gebaut wurde. Als solcher '
         'verfügt der Hubschrauber über ein integriertes „Health & Monitoring '
         'System“ (IVHMS), das den Betrieb des gesamten Luftfahrzeugs '
         'überwacht, den Wartungsbedarf wichtiger Bauteile erkennt und deren '
         'Instandhaltung vereinfacht. Zusätzlich sollen Teile des Projektteams '
         'direkt am Flughafen angesiedelt werden. Hintergrund: Sikorsky und '
         'Rheinmetall bewerben sich aktuell mit einem Konsortium aus mehr als '
         'zehn führenden deutschen Technologieunternehmen, darunter MTU Aero '
         'Engines, Autoflug, Hydro, Hensoldt, ZF Friedrichshafen sowie Rohde & '
         'Schwarz, mit dem CH-53K „King Stallion“ um die Nachfolge des '
         'Schweren Transporthubschraubers der Bundeswehr. Die Frist zur Abgabe '
         'des Angebots endet im Januar 2020. Anfang 2021 soll die Entscheidung '

 'text': 'OWEGO , N.Y., Oct. 29, 2019 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) received a '
         '$25 million initial contract award for engineering and manufacturing '
         'development (EMD) for the GPS Spatial Temporal Anti-Jam Receiver '
         '(GSTAR) system that will be integrated into the F-35 as part of its '
         'modernization phase, also known as Block 4. The GSTAR system will '
         'replace the current Antenna Electronics Unit (AEU) and will provide '
         'enhanced capabilities including the next-generation, anti-jam '
         'solution and provide a significant weight and cost reduction to the '
         'aircraft. The F-35 today is the most technologically advanced '
         'fighter ever built. As threats advance and technology evolves, the '
         'joint government and industry team is modernizing the system to '
         'ensure it remains a step ahead. GSTAR is one of several key '
         'enhancements planned across the F-35’s sensors, data links, engine, '
         'mission systems, weapons and more. “We are proud to be the supplier '
         'of choice for the F-35 upgrade program and look forward to providing '
         'the GSTAR system for years to come,” said Hamid Salim, vice '
         'president, Advanced Product Solutions at Lockheed Martin Rotary and '
         'Mission Systems. “This award is a testament to our Lockheed '
         'Martin-wide focus on innovation and advanced technology for the F-35 '
         'and our warfighters.” The GSTAR is a fully digital system that '
         'provides the greatest protection against adversarial jamming and '
         'spoofing by utilizing critical GPS capabilities that can quickly '
         'adapt to meet specific platform requirements. The GSTAR system '
         'includes a dynamic range Radio Frequency (RF) front-end, digital '
         'beamformer and receiver that has been tested and proven against a '
         'variety of threat scenarios. Lockheed Martin is a leader in the '
         'development of anti-jam GPS (AJ-GPS) technology for 20 years and has '
         'fielded more than 2,500 GSTAR systems. The GSTAR system provides '
         'highly effective digital Electronic Protection (EP) for any platform '
         'that relies on GPS for navigation. With stealth technology, advanced '
         'sensors, supersonic speed, weapons capacity and superior range, the '
         'F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and connected aircraft in the '
         "world. More than a fighter jet, the F-35's ability to collect, "
         'analyze and share data, is a powerful force multiplier that enhances '
         'all airborne, surface and ground-based assets in the battlespace '
         'enabling men and women in uniform to execute their mission and '

 'text': 'DENVER, Colo., October 21, 2019 – A new global, military, '
         'satellite-based cellular network designed to revolutionize secure '
         'communications for mobile forces is now ready for full operational '
         'use in warfighting environments. The Mobile User Objective System ( '
         'MUOS ), developed by prime contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'with ground systems provider General Dynamics Mission Systems (NYSE: '
         'GD), was deemed operationally effective, operationally suitable, and '
         'cyber survivable, following successful completion of its '
         'Multiservice Operational Test and Evaluation (MOT&E). This summer’s '
         'rigorous MOT&E, conducted by the U.S. Navy’s Commander, Operational '
         'Test and Evaluation Force, included participation from the U.S. Army '
         'and the U.S. Marine Corps. Mobile forces have been conducting early '
         'testing and training on MUOS since the network was approved for '
         'Early Combatant Command use in July 2016. In August 2018 , U.S. '
         'Strategic Command approved MUOS for expanded operational use to '
         'include non-combat operations – like humanitarian response, disaster '
         'relief and further training. The successful MOT&E now makes MUOS’ '
         'advanced communications capabilities fully available to the tactical '
         'warfare environment. Comprised of five geosynchronous satellites and '
         'four geographically dispersed relay ground stations, the MUOS '
         'network brings to mobile forces new, simultaneous, crystal-clear '
         'voice, video and mission data over a secure high-speed Internet '
         'Protocol-based system. Users with new MUOS terminals will be able to '
         'seamlessly connect beyond line-of-sight around the world and into '
         'the Global Information Grid, as well as into the Defense Switched '
         'Network. MUOS also has demonstrated successful communication of '
         'Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) messages. “MUOS is a game changer '
         'for our troops, providing incredible new voice and data capabilities '
         'with near global coverage from satellites that act like cell towers '
         '22,000 miles above the Earth,” said Kay Sears, vice president and '
         'general manager of Lockheed Martin’s Military Space line of '
         'business. “Imagine leaping in technology from a walkie-talkie to a '
         'modern cellular phone with global reach. This is what MUOS is for '
         'our troops and its network technology will provide more than 10 '
         'times the communications capacity the legacy UHF SATCOM system can '
         'provide.” “MUOS will provide a level of voice and data '
         'communications capability that warfighters have never had using '
         'legacy SATCOM systems,” said Manny Mora, vice president and general '
         'manager for the Space and Intelligence Systems line of business at '
         'General Dynamics Mission Systems. “With voice clarity and data speed '
         'rivaling what civilians enjoy on their cellphones, MUOS delivers a '
         'tactical communications and operational advantage. Wherever our '
         'forces are deployed, MUOS will be there.” Today MUOS’ satellites, '
         'built by Lockheed Martin, provide both the advanced, new Wideband '
         'Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) waveform and legacy SATCOM UHF '
         'communications signals to support troops as they transition over to '
         'the more-versatile cellular network. MUOS’ ground system, built by '
         'General Dynamics Mission Systems, has two locations in the United '
         'States, one in Australia and one in Europe -- each supporting the '
         'system’s global, beyond-line-of-sight, narrowband communications '

         'or new accounting standards until such items have been consummated, '
         'enacted or adopted. For additional factors that may impact the '
         'corporation\'s actual results, refer to the "Forward-Looking '
         'Statements" section in this news release. (in millions, except per '

         'per share 2 ~$21.55 $20.85 - $21.15 Cash from operations ≥$7,600 '
         '≥$7,600 1 The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment above is presented as a '
         'single amount and includes expected 2019 U.S. Government cost '
         'accounting standards (CAS) pension cost of approximately $2,565 '
         'million and expected financial accounting standards (FAS) pension '
         'expense of approximately $1,090 million. CAS pension cost and the '
         'service cost component of FAS pension expense is included in '
         'operating profit as part of cost of sales. The non-service cost '
         'components of FAS pension expense are included in other '
         "non-operating expense, net in the corporation's consolidated "
         "statements of earnings. For additional detail on the corporation's "
         'FAS/CAS pension adjustment see the supplemental table included at '
         'the end of this news release. 2 Although the corporation typically '
         'does not update its outlook for proposed changes in law, the above '
         'includes the effect of proposed tax regulations confirming that '
         'foreign military sales (FMS) qualify for tax deductions for foreign '
         'derived intangible income. The corporation believes incorporating '
         'the effect of the proposed regulations yields more accurate '
         "disclosure of the company's expectations because the proposed "
         'regulations describe the tax treatment of FMS sales in accordance '
         "with the corporation's analysis of the Internal Revenue Code. 3 The "
         "corporation's financial outlook for 2019 does not include potential "
         "impacts to the corporation's programs, including the F-35 program, "
         'resulting from U.S. Government actions related to Turkey or '
         'potential financial impacts related to the U.S. Government operating '
         'under a continuing resolution funding measure. During periods '
         'covered by continuing resolutions or until the regular '
         'appropriations bills are passed, the corporation may experience '
         'delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of '
         'funding, and those delays may affect its results of operations. The '
         'corporation currently does not expect either of these events to have '
         'an impact on its 2019 financial results. 2020 Financial Trends The '
         'corporation expects its 2020 net sales to increase to approximately '
         '$62.0 billion . Total business segment operating margin in 2020 is '
         'expected to be in the 10.5 percent to 10.8 percent range and cash '
         'from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $7.2 '
         'billion , net of $500 million of pension contributions. The '
         'preliminary outlook for 2020 assumes there is no impact from U.S. '
         'Government actions related to Turkey and the U.S. Government '
         "continues to support and fund the corporation's key programs. "
         'Changes in circumstances may require the corporation to revise its '
         "assumptions, which could materially change the corporation's current "
         'estimate of 2020 net sales, operating margin and cash flows. The '
         'corporation currently expects a total net FAS/CAS pension benefit of '
         'approximately $2.1 billion in 2020. This estimate assumes a 3.25 '
         'percent discount rate (a 100 basis point decrease from the end of '
         '2018), a 15.00 percent return on plan assets in 2019, and a 7.00 '
         'percent expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future '
         'years, among other assumptions. A change of plus or minus 25 basis '
         'points to the assumed discount rate, with all other assumptions held '
         'constant, would result in an incremental increase or decrease of '
         'approximately $15 million to the estimated net 2020 FAS/CAS pension '
         'benefit. The impact of changes in the discount rate is significantly '
         'less than in prior years (i.e., $15 million for 2020 compared to '
         '$120 million for 2019) due to the expected completion of the planned '
         "freeze of the corporation's salaried pension plans that was "
         'previously announced on July 1, 2014 , which\xa0is discussed in '
         'further detail below. A change of 100 basis points to the return on '
         'plan assets in 2019, with all other assumptions held constant, would '
         'impact the net 2020 FAS/CAS pension benefit by approximately $15 '
         'million . As noted above, the corporation expects to make '
         'contributions of approximately $500 million to its qualified defined '
         'benefit pension plans in 2020 and anticipates recovering '
         'approximately $2.2 billion of CAS pension cost. The corporation will '
         'complete the annual remeasurement of its postretirement benefit '
         'plans and update its estimated 2020 FAS/CAS pension adjustment on '
         'Dec. 31, 2019 . The final assumptions and actual investment return '
         'for 2019 may differ materially from those discussed above. As '
         'previously announced on July 1, 2014 , the corporation will complete '
         'the final step of the planned freeze of its qualified and '
         'nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees '
         'effective Jan. 1, 2020 . The service-based component of the formula '
         'used to determine retirement benefits will be frozen such that '
         'participants will no longer earn further credited service for any '
         'period after Dec. 31, 2019 . As a result of these changes, the plans '
         'will be fully frozen effective Jan. 1, 2020 . Retirees already '
         'collecting benefits and former employees with a vested benefit will '
         'not be affected by the change. Current employees also will retain '
         'all benefits already earned in their pension plan to date. Cash '
         "Activities The corporation's cash activities in the third quarter of "
         '2019 included the following: As previously reported on Sept. 26, '
         '2019 , the corporation increased its quarterly dividend by $0.20 per '
         'share, to $2.40 per share, beginning with the dividend payment in '
         'the fourth quarter of 2019. The corporation also increased its share '
         'repurchase authority by $1.0 billion with $3.3 billion in total '
         'remaining authorization for future repurchases of common stock under '
         'the program as of Sept. 29, 2019 . Segment Results The corporation '
         'operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of '
         'products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire '
         'Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. The '

         "cost in each of its business segment's net sales and cost of sales. "
         "The corporation's consolidated financial statements must present "
         'pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in '
         'accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles '
         '(referred to as FAS pension expense). The operating portion of the '
         'net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the '
         'service cost component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. '
         'The non-service FAS pension cost component is included in other '
         "non‑operating expense, net on the corporation's consolidated "
         'statements of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases '
         'or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense '
         '(both service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating '
         'profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume '
         'refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit '
         'resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or '
         'service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment '
         'operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking '
         'rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of the '
         "corporation's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin "
         'may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit '
         "booking rates on the corporation's contracts for which it recognizes "
         'revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost '
         'method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in profit '
         'booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually '
         'relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the '
         'performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a '
         'particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract '
         'may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total '
         'costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the '
         'profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates '
         'are recognized in the current period and reflect the '
         'inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit '
         'and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other '
         'items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may '
         'include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost '
         'recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance '
         'recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may '
         'include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring '
         'charges, except for significant severance actions which are excluded '
         'from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset '
         'impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. The '
         "corporation's consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, "
         'including net profit booking rate adjustments, represented '
         'approximately 29 percent of total segment operating profit in the '

 'text': 'LEIPZIG, Germany, Oct. 29, 2019 -- To support Germany’s "Schwerer '
         'Transporthubschrauber" (STH) heavy lift helicopter program, '
         'Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company, and Rheinmetall announced today '
         'that they intend to set up a logistics and fleet management center '
         'at Leipzig/Halle Airport if the Bundeswehr selects the CH-53K as its '
         'next heavy-lift transport helicopter. This would establish numerous '
         'high-tech jobs and strengthen Leipzig and the local airport as a '
         'prime business location in the long term. Rheinmetall and Sikorsky '
         'are working with the airport operator in Leipzig to establish the '
         'center, which is necessary for the operation of the helicopter '
         'fleet. Both companies have also informed lawmakers and the Economic '
         'Development Corporation of the State of Saxony. “We are in advanced '
         'talks on a logistics and maintenance hub at Leipzig Airport,” said '
         'Mike Schmidt, managing director of Rheinmetall Aviation Services '
         'GmbH. “We are delighted with the very positive response so far. If '
         'the application is successful, the maintenance and supply of the new '
         'Bundeswehr transport helicopter could be carried out centrally and '
         'efficiently in Leipzig. For the region, the project would mean the '
         'settlement of important industry and associated jobs.” Sikorsky and '
         'Rheinmetall have assembled a team of leading German technology '
         'companies including MTU Aero Engines, ZF Luftfahrttechnik GmbH, '
         'Autoflug, HYDRO Systems KG, Collins Aerospace, Vincorion, Hensoldt '
         'and Rohde & Schwarz. “We have built up a strong industrial team in '
         'Germany that will ensure the availability of the CH-53K fleet for '
         'the German Air Force,” said Christian Albrecht, business development '
         'manager at Sikorsky in Berlin, and a former Chief Operating Officer '
         'for maintenance management with the 64 th Helicopter Wing of the '
         'German Air Force at Holzdorf Air Base. “With our plans for a hub at '
         'Leipzig/Halle Airport, we are laying the foundation to provide the '
         'Bundeswehr with a helicopter that will be reliable for several '
         'decades to come.” In addition to using existing hangars and storage '
         'areas at Leipzig/Halle Airport, the team will establish a fleet '
         'management center where technical helicopter data can be evaluated. '
         'The multi-mission CH-53K is the most modern, intelligent and capable '
         'heavy transport helicopter ever built. As such, the helicopter has '
         'an Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring System (IVHMS) that monitors '
         'the operation of the entire aircraft, recognizes the maintenance '
         'requirements of important components and simplifies their '
         'maintenance. This will result in much higher readiness rates '
         'compared to today´s legacy fleets. In addition, members the project '
         'team will be located directly at the airport. The Bundeswehr is '
         'expected to award a contract for its new heavy-lift helicopter in '
         '2021. With the CH-53K, the Bundeswehr will receive a proven '
         'helicopter with low life-cycle costs, unparalleled growth potential '
         'and no need for costly and time-consuming retrofits in the coming '
         'decades. For more information, visit our webpage: '

         'tradition dating back centuries, a shipyard worker welded the '
         'initials of Polly Spencer , USS Nantucket ship sponsor and wife of '
         "U.S. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer , into the ship's keel "
         'plate. This plate will be affixed to the ship and travel with '
         'Nantucket throughout its commissioned life. "The USS Nantucket will '
         'confront many complex challenges," said Richard V. Spencer , the '
         'U.S. Secretary of the Navy. "It will confront humanitarian relief '
         'all the way to great power competition, drawing on the strength of '
         'every weld, every rivet applied by the great people here." Unique '
         'among combat ships, the focused-mission LCS is designed to support '
         'mine countermeasures, anti-submarine and surface warfare missions '

         'integrating mission equipment and deploying manned and unmanned '
         'aerial, surface or sub-surface vehicles." LCS 27 is the first Navy '
         'ship to be named after Nantucket, Massachusetts in more than 150 '
         'years. Nantucket has a deep connection to sailing and maritime '

         "generations of American sailors since the town's beginning. The "
         'previous USS Nantucket, the first to be named after the island, was '
         'commissioned in 1862 to serve during the American Civil War. "I have '
         'been given a very special honor in being the sponsor of the future '
         'USS Nantucket. I am happy she is being built here in Marinette, '
         'Wisconsin , which has an impressive history of shipbuilding," said '

         '(NHSL), a leading Sikorsky S-76® helicopter operator, is expanding '
         'operations with its first two S-76D™ aircraft in Guyana, a '
         'continuation of the significant growth of Sikorsky and Lockheed '
         'Martin in Latin America.\xa0NHSL has operated Sikorsky helicopters '
         'for nearly 40 years, providing offshore transport services to the '
         'oil-and-gas sector and other commercial entities, as well as '
         'government services for emergency and natural disaster response. '
         'Sikorsky is a Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: LMT). “Sikorsky’s '
         'venerable S-76 has long history in this important offshore region” '
         'said Adam Schierholz, Sikorsky Regional Executive for Latin America. '
         '“The S-76D provides a more affordable, reliable, efficient service '
         'compared to other alternative medium-class aircraft, and we are '
         'thrilled to see the S-76D start operations in another new country.” '
         '“The demanding pace and environments in which we operate speak to '
         'the S-76’s value, reliability and performance,” said Capt. Homer '
         'Solomon, the Trinidad-Tobago-based NHSL Director of Operations. “We '
         'are proud to be the launch operator of the S-76D in Guyana, and we '
         'value the aircraft’s noticeably lesser fuel burn, quieter cabin, '
         'lower vibration levels and cost-effectiveness for our operations.” '
         'The six S-76s currently in the NHSL fleet include three Sikorsky '
         'S-76C++ and three S-76D aircraft. NHSL completed the first-ever '
         'commercial revenue flight with the S-76D in February 2014, and since '
         'then, NHSL S-76Ds have flown more than 10,000 hours, with 97%+ '
         'availability rates. Guyana is the 51 st country in which the S-76 '
         'will operate and a further extension of Sikorsky and parent company '
         'Lockheed Martin’s expanding reach into Latin America and other '
         'emerging global markets. More than 300 Sikorsky aircraft are '
         'currently flying in Latin America in a variety of roles and '
         'missions, including 29 S-92s in Brazil where a multitude of S-76s '
         'have operated through the years, most notably in the Off-Shore Oil '
         'transport segment. Since 2007, the fleet of Sikorsky helicopters in '
         'the Latin America region has doubled to more than 300 with the S-92 '
         'as the workhorse heavy lift aircraft in offshore oil service and the '
         'UH-60 Black Hawk as the pre-eminent utility helicopter in regional '
         'military and paramilitary service. The legendary S-76® helicopter '
         'operates successfully in more than 40 countries on six continents, '
         'fulfilling its many missions in varied environmental conditions. '
         'Sikorsky has delivered more than 875 S-76\xa0helicopters to '
         'customers globally since 1977, contributing daily to a growing total '
         'of more than 7.4 million flight hours. The S-76D helicopter, through '

 'text': 'STRATFORD, Conn. , Sept. 24, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE: LMT) today announced the Sikorsky HH-60W Combat Rescue '
         'Helicopter (CRH) program achieved a Milestone C decision from the '
         'U.S. Air Force, which moves the program into low rate initial '
         'production. The Combat Rescue Helicopter will perform critical '
         'combat search and rescue and personnel recovery operations for all '
         'U.S. military services. View the latest CRH video.  CRH Helicopter '
         'Proves Ready for Sacred Mission The four instrumented test aircraft '
         'at the Sikorsky Development Flight Center in West Palm Beach, '
         'Florida , demonstrated their production readiness during rigorous '
         'U.S. Air Force (USAF) performance and flight load survey testing. '
         'The joint Sikorsky and USAF flight test team has executed over 150 '
         'hours of envelope expansion flights, which provided USAF the data '
         'necessary to execute a Milestone C decision. This decision allows '
         'Sikorsky to begin production of the aircraft, which is based on the '
         'venerable BLACK HAWK helicopter. "This affirmative Milestone C '
         "decision validates the modifications to Sikorsky's most successful "
         'BLACK HAWK helicopter, making it capable of saving downed airmen '
         'anytime, anywhere around the world," said Greg Hames , Sikorsky '
         'program director. "This establishes the Combat Rescue Helicopter as '
         'a production program." Prepared for Production There are five CRH '
         "aircraft in various stages of production at Sikorsky's Stratford "
         'facility. Sikorsky employees and our nationwide supply chain are '
         'ready to begin production and support delivering this all new '
         'aircraft to the warfighter. The USAF program of record calls for 113 '
         'helicopters to replace its predecessor, the Sikorsky HH-60G PAVE '
         'HAWKs. "We have just successfully gained approval to launch the '
         'production of a helicopter that will save the lives of our '
         'warfighters and our allies all over the world. This decision begins '
         'the transition to this more capable and reliable helicopter to '
         "fulfill the Air Force's mission to leave no one behind.\xa0I could "
         'not be more proud of\xa0our government-contractor team for making '
         'this happen," said Col. Dale R. White , Program Executive Officer, '
         'Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Special Operations '
         'Forces, USAF. The CRH is significantly more capable and reliable '
         'than the HH-60G PAVE HAWK. The aircraft hosts a new fuel system that '
         'nearly doubles the capacity of the internal tank on a UH-60M BLACK '
         'HAWK, giving the USAF crew extended range and more capability to '
         'rescue those injured in the battle space. The CRH specification '
         'drives more capable defensive systems and enhances the vulnerability '

 'text': 'ORLÉANS,\xa0France, Sept. 19, 2019 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'delivered the first of two KC-130J Super Hercules aerial refuelers '
         "to representatives from France’s Armée de l'Air's 62st Transport "
         'Wing at Orléans-Bricy Air Base today. France will receive a total of '
         'four Super Hercules aircraft — two C-130J-30 combat delivery '
         'airlifters and two KC-130J aerial refuelers — through a Foreign '
         'Military Sale with the U.S. government. The two C-130J-30 airlifters '
         'were delivered in 2017 and 2018, and a second KC-130J will deliver '
         'in 2020. All of these Super Hercules are operated in conjunction '
         'with France’s existing C-130H fleet. “The KC-130J provides Armée de '
         "l'Air crews with a proven solution that delivers much-needed fuel in "
         'any environment, at any time,” said Rod McLean, vice president and '
         'general manager, Air Mobility & Maritime Missions at Lockheed '
         'Martin. “In choosing to operate both the C-130J-30 and the KC-130J, '
         'France has built a diverse airlift fleet that expands both the '
         'capabilities and global reach of the French Armed Forces.” France is '
         'the 17th country to choose the C-130J for its airlift needs. The '
         'C-130J Super Hercules is the most advanced tactical airlifter in '
         'operation today, offering superior performance and enhanced '
         'capabilities with the range and versatility for every theater of '
         'operations and evolving requirements. As the preeminent tactical '
         'aerial refueling tanker, the KC-130J is a battle-tested solution '
         'that takes full advantage of the tremendous technological and '
         'performance improvements inherent in the C-130J Super Hercules '
         'aircraft. A true force multiplier, the KC-130J refuels both fixed '
         'wing and rotary wing aircraft as well as conducts rapid ground '
         'refueling. With this delivery, France joins a global community of '
         'KC-130J operators. In 2018, Germany announced the acquisition of a '
         'C-130J-30/KC-130J fleet, to be operated in partnership with France — '

         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) have finalized a contract for the production and '
         'operations of six Orion spacecraft missions and the ability to order '
         "up to 12 in total. Orion is NASA's deep space exploration spaceship "
         'that will carry astronauts from Earth to the Moon and bring them '
         'safely home. Lockheed Martin has been the prime contractor during '
         'the development phase of the Orion program. "This contract clearly '
         "shows NASA's commitment not only to Orion, but also to Artemis and "
         'its bold goal of sending humans to the Moon in the next five years," '
         'said Rick Ambrose , executive vice president of Lockheed Martin '
         'Space. "We are equally committed to Orion and Artemis and producing '
         'these vehicles with a focus on cost, schedule and mission success." '
         "The agency's Orion Production and Operations Contract (OPOC) is an "
         'indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contact for NASA to '
         'issue both cost-plus-incentive fee and firm-fixed-price orders. '
         'Initially, NASA has ordered three Orion spacecraft for Artemis '
         'missions III-V for $2.7 billion . Then in fiscal year 2022, the '
         'agency plans to order three additional Orion spacecraft for Artemis '
         'missions VI-VIII for $1.9 billion . OPOC will realize substantial '
         'savings compared to the costs of vehicles built during the design, '
         'development, test and evaluation (DDT&E) phase. Up to six additional '
         'Orion spacecraft may be ordered under the IDIQ contract through '
         'Sept. 30, 2030 , leveraging spacecraft production cost data from the '
         'previous six missions to enable the lowest possible unit prices. The '
         'first spacecraft delivered on this contract, Artemis III, will carry '
         'the first woman and the next man to the Moon in 2024, where they '
         'will dock with the Gateway and ultimately land on the surface using '
         "a lunar landing system. Orion is a critical part of the agency's "
         'Artemis program to build a sustainable presence on the lunar surface '
         'and to prepare us to move on to Mars. Reusable Orion crew modules '
         'and systems, use of advanced manufacturing technologies, material '
         'and component bulk buys and an accelerated mission cadence all '
         'contribute to considerable cost reductions on these production '
         'vehicles. "We have learned a lot about how to design and manufacture '
         'a better Orion—such as designing for reusability, using augmented '
         "reality and additive manufacturing—and we're applying this to this "
         'next series of vehicles. Driving down cost and manufacturing them '
         'more efficiently and faster will be key to making the Artemis '
         'program a success," said Mike Hawes , Orion program manager for '
         'Lockheed Martin Space. "One must also appreciate how unique Orion '
         "is. It's a spaceship like none other. We've designed it to do things "
         'no other spacecraft can do, go to places no astronaut has been and '
         'take us into a new era of human deep space exploration." Lockheed '
         'Martin and NASA recently announced the completion of the Orion crew '

         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) Skunk Works ® , the Missile Defense Agency and '
         'the U.S. Air Force successfully connected an F-35, U-2 and a '
         'multi-domain ground station in a ground-breaking test demonstrating '
         'multi-domain operations and the secure distribution of sensitive '
         'information across multiple platforms. During the demonstration, '
         'called Project Riot, an F-35 detected a long-range missile launch '
         'with its onboard sensors and shared the information through the U-2 '
         'to the air defense commander on the ground, enabling the commander '
         'to quickly make the decision to target the threat. This next-level '
         'connectivity reduces the data-to-decision timeline from minutes to '
         "seconds, which is critical in fighting today's adversaries and "
         'advanced threats. In partnership with the Air Force Life Cycle '
         'Management Center at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts , and the '
         "Missile Defense Agency, Skunk Works' Project Riot builds on a series "
         'of open systems architecture demonstrations proving how incremental '
         'increases in capability can be rapidly fielded to enable a connected '
         'network across air, ground, sea, space and cyber domains. "This '
         'demonstration continues our commitment to provide complete '
         'battlespace awareness and seamless interoperability to enable '
         'multi-domain operations," said John Clark , vice president of ISR & '
         'UAS at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. "With its long-range standoff '
         'sensors, on-board processing and ability to operate in and around '
         'contested environments, the U-2 continues to play a critical role in '
         'demonstrating new capabilities today, while transforming operations '
         'for tomorrow\'s battlespace." Leveraging common industry standards '
         'to drive down cost and shorten schedules, the team achieved four '
         'mission critical data points in less than four months: "The F-35, '
         'with its advanced sensors and connectivity, is able to gather and '
         'seamlessly share critical information enabling the joint force to be '
         'safer and more effective," said Greg Ulmer , Lockheed Martin vice '
         'president and general manager for the F-35 program. "No other '
         'fighter jet in the world has this capability – and this test was a '
         'critical step on the path to unlocking its full potential for '
         'multi-domain operations." This demonstration builds on successful '
         'flight tests completed since 2013 that establish the foundation for '
         'a distributed, systems-of-systems architecture in the '

         "PRNewswire / --\xa0Lockheed Martin's (NYSE: LMT) Terminal High "
         'Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system successfully intercepted a '
         'medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) target today in a missile '
         'defense test led by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency with critical '
         'support provided by the U.S. Army. During the test, designated '
         'Flight Test THAAD (FTT-23), the THAAD system located at U.S. Army '
         'Garrison Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands '
         'successfully detected, tracked and intercepted a threat '
         'representative target using a THAAD launcher that was positioned at '
         'distance from the other THAAD end items. The THAAD radar detected, '
         'acquired and tracked the target. The THAAD system then developed a '
         'fire control solution and launched an interceptor from a '
         "remotely-located THAAD launcher that destroyed the target's reentry "
         'vehicle. This was the 16th successful intercept in 16 attempts for '
         'the THAAD system since 2005. The THAAD system now has the capability '
         'to physically untether a THAAD launcher from the battle manager and '
         'launch interceptors remotely, greatly enhancing launcher emplacement '
         'options and increasing the defended area. "The enhanced THAAD system '
         "performed flawlessly in today's test, and we are proud to support "
         'the Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Army as they continue to '
         'demonstrate the system\'s unmatched capabilities," said Richard '
         'McDaniel , vice president of Upper Tier Integrated Air and Missile '
         'Defense Systems at Lockheed Martin. "This successful test paves the '
         'way for delivery of an urgent need capability that will enhance '
         'THAAD\'s emplacement options resulting in greater asset protection." '
         'THAAD is highly effective at defending against a host of ballistic '
         'missile threats to include mass raid scenarios. The system uses '
         'hit-to-kill technology to destroy a threat with direct impact '
         'neutralizing lethal payloads before they reach protected assets on '
         'the ground. The system is rapidly deployable, mobile and '
         'interoperable with all other Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) '
         'elements, including Patriot/PAC-3, Aegis, forward-based sensors and '

 'text': 'WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Sept. 23, 2019 -- Recent flight tests of the '
         'Sikorsky HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter included testing of a new '
         'tactical mission kit, which provides premier situational awareness, '
         'mission management and simple sensor integration. The kit, developed '
         'by Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: LMT), includes '
         'high-end mission processing for situational awareness, defensive '
         'systems, datalinks and onboard mission planning. “This tactical '
         'mission kit leverages the knowledge we’ve gained from developing '
         'open architecture systems that are easily transportable across '
         'multiple aircraft and missions, ultimately leading to reduced '
         'lifecycle costs for any program,” said Mission Systems Program '
         'Director Scott Breen. “The tactical mission kit is another example '
         'of our commitment to open systems that reduce pilot and crew mission '
         'management workload while increasing situational awareness in high '
         'task load environments.” The tactical mission kit is aligned with '
         'the U.S. Department of Defense Future Airborne Capability '
         'Environment (FACE™) Technical Standard, which allows for greater '
         'growth and adaptability for easy sensor, data link, threat warning '
         'and countermeasure system changes. The software runs on two fully '
         'redundant common mission processors that feature powerful multi-core '
         'processing and the ability to drive multiple displays in a small, '
         'lightweight package. The Sikorsky approach for the design and '
         'implementation of the tactical mission kit and its open architecture '
         'utilizes the same approach and reuse seen on current and future '
         'programs such as C-130T, A-10, German P-3C, MH-60R/S, HH-60W and '
         'Future Vertical Lift (FVL). For more information, visit '

 'text': "DENVER , Aug. 22, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- The U.S. Air Force's second "
         'next-generation GPS III satellite, built by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: '
         'LMT), is responding to commands, under control and now using its own '
         'internal propulsion system to get to orbit following its successful '
         'launch this morning.  At about 11:01 a.m. ET , Air Force and '
         "Lockheed Martin engineers at Lockheed Martin's Launch & Checkout "
         'Facility near Denver declared they had full control of GPS III Space '
         "Vehicle 02 ( GPS III SV02 ) shortly after the satellite's separation "
         'from its United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV rocket booster. The '
         'satellite, nicknamed "Magellan" by the Air Force, began its rocket '
         'ride to space with a\xa09: 06 a.m. ET launch from Cape Canaveral Air '
         'Force Station. GPS III SV02 is now climbing towards its operational '
         'orbit about 12,550 miles above the earth under the power of its own '
         "Liquid Apogee engines. Engineers at Lockheed Martin Space's "
         'Waterton, Colorado facility are commanding the satellite using '
         'elements of the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) '
         'Block 0. "GPS III SV02 is receiving and responding to commands just '
         "as planned. In the days ahead, we'll finish orbit raising to our "
         'operational slot and then send the satellite commands telling it to '
         'deploy its solar arrays and antennas," said\xa0Johnathon Caldwell, '
         "Lockheed Martin Space's Vice President for Navigation Systems. "
         '"Once we are set up, we\'ll begin on-orbit checkout and tests, '
         'including extensive signals testing with our advanced navigation '
         'payload." GPS III SV02 is the second GPS III satellite designed and '
         "built by Lockheed Martin to help the Air Force modernize today's "
         'Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation with new technology '
         'and capabilities. GPS III satellites provide 3x greater accuracy and '
         'up to 8x improved anti-jamming capabilities. GPS III also provides a '
         'new L1C civil signal, compatible with other international global '
         "navigation satellite systems, like Europe's Galileo. The First GPS "
         'III Satellite Completes On Orbit Testing GPS III SV02 will be the '
         'second GPS III satellite in orbit and the second GPS III satellite '
         "now being commanded from Lockheed Martin Space's facility. On "
         'December 23, 2018 , the Air Force launched the first GPS III '
         'satellite. Nicknamed "Vespucci," GPS III SV01 underwent months of '
         'checkout and thorough testing of its advanced, new navigation '
         'payload provided by Harris Corporation. "GPS III SV01\'s performance '
         'exceeded expectations during testing," Caldwell said. "On July 12 , '
         'we officially completed all On Orbit Check Out & Test activities. We '
         'are excited to see this satellite move to the next phase and perform '
         'in an operational environment." That\'s expected to happen later '
         'this year once the first satellite is handed over to the Air Force. '
         'Thinking Ahead From the Ground Up In preparation for this handover, '
         'in 2016, the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin the GPS III '
         'Contingency Operations (COps) contract to upgrade its current GPS '
         'ground control system – the Operational Control Segment (OCS) – to '
         'be able to "fly" today\'s 31-satellite constellation, as well as the '
         'new, more-powerful GPS III satellites, until OCX Block 1, still in '
         'development, is delivered. Lockheed Martin delivered the GPS III '
         'COps software upgrade in May and it is currently undergoing '
         'preparations for installation. COps is the latest GPS ground control '
         'upgrade project Lockheed Martin has had since it began sustaining '
         'the OCS in 2013. In\xa0November 2018, the company completed the AEP '
         "7.5 upgrade -- the largest architectural change in the system's "
         'history -- replacing significant code, hardware and software to '
         "improve the system's cybersecurity capabilities and positioning the "
         'Air Force to better operate in contested, degraded and operationally '
         'limited environments. In\xa0December 2018,  the Air Force awarded '
         'Lockheed Martin the GPS Control Segment Sustainment II (GCS II) '
         'contract to continue to further modernize and sustain the OCS '
         'through 2025. In 2020, the OCS is expected to receive the M-Code '
         'Early Use (MCEU) upgrade, which will allow control of M-Code, an '
         'advanced,\xa0new signal designed to improve anti-jamming and '
         'anti-spoofing, as well as to increase secure access to military\xa0'
         'GPS\xa0signals for U.S. and allied armed forces. With GPS III SV01 '
         'and SV02 now on orbit, GPS III satellites continue to roll off the '
         "production line at Lockheed Martin's advanced $128-million GPS III "
         'Processing Facility near Denver . On May 27 , the Air Force declared '
         'the GPS III SV03 "Available for Launch" (AFL) and had the company '
         'place it into storage waiting for a launch date. GPS III SV04-08 are '
         'now in various stages of assembly and test. In all, Lockheed Martin '
         'is under contract to build up to 32 next-generation GPS III/IIIF '
         'satellites for the Air Force. Additional "IIIF" capabilities will '
         'begin being added at the 11 th satellite. These will include a fully '
         'digital navigation payload, a Regional Military Protection '
         'capability, an accuracy-enhancing laser retroreflector array, and a '
         'Search & Rescue payload. Lockheed Martin is proud to be a part of '
         "the Air Force's GPS III team. The GPS III team is led by the "

 'text': 'COLORADO SPRINGS , Co., Sept. 17, 2019 – Pulsar Guardian is a new, '
         'state-of-the art facility built by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) in '
         'Colorado Springs that lets the Air Force and others simulate, test '
         'and train in a multi-domain environment that reflects today’s '
         'complex space environment. For the first time, warfighters can bring '
         'in any tool, from any company to simulate, test and train in a '
         'realistic synthetic space environment without disrupting real '
         'missions. Pulsar Guardian follows the U.S. Air Force Universal '
         'Command and Control Interface standard (UCI) and is fully compliant. '
         '“Pulsar Guardian reflects a new way for space operators to evaluate '
         'new systems, changes to existing ones, or train on the platforms '
         'they use every day,” said Maria Demaree, Lockheed Martin Space vice '
         'president and general manager of Mission Solutions. “Wargaming and '
         'training have never been as immersive – it’s a game changer.” '
         'Multi-Domain Operations require new, agile spaces that the military '
         'can use to integrate, synchronize and simulate battle conditions '
         'without interrupting present-day operations. Pulsar Guardian can '
         'simulate what an Air-Space-Integration looks like by showing how an '
         'unmanned aircraft or fighter jet could interface directly with a '
         'satellite and get the right data at the right time to take action. '
         'Cyber attacks and mitigations can be tested in a sandboxed, '
         'collaborative environment. Pulsar Guardian is a new class of '
         'collaborative space that links into a network of fully-immersive '
         'workspaces across Lockheed Martin Space. Pulsar facilities reduce '
         'travel time and costs for customers and Lockheed Martin employees '
         'through being able to quickly bring subject matter experts and '
         'engineers from around the globe into the conversation to quickly '

 'text': 'ARLINGTON, Va. , Aug. 13, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- Cyber experts from '
         'Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] developed and piloted a '
         'first-of-its-kind model that standardizes how to measure the cyber '
         'resiliency maturity of a weapon, mission, and/or training system '
         'anywhere in its lifecycle – the Cyber Resiliency Level™ model (CRL ® '
         '). The U.S. government defines "cyber resiliency" as the ability to '
         'anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to changing '
         'conditions in order to maintain the functions necessary for mission '
         'effective capability. Until now, the aerospace and defense industry '
         'lacked a simple, common method to discuss cyber resiliency of a '
         'military system. "Today\'s software-based military systems and a '
         'global supply chain make securing military systems a complex problem '
         'to solve," said Jim Keffer , director of Cyber, Lockheed Martin '
         'Government Affairs. "With the CRL, we can now leverage existing risk '
         'management frameworks to effectively measure and communicate '
         'resiliency across six categories we know are important to our '
         "customers. The release of this model builds on Lockheed Martin's "
         'enduring commitment to mission assurance and will ultimately help '
         'the warfighter operate in cyber-contested environments." To use the '
         'model, engineers work with U.S. and allied military program '
         'stakeholders to conduct a series of risk and engineering '
         'assessments. The process provides increased visibility into the '
         'current state of risk and produces a customized, risk-mitigation '
         "roadmap that shows how to increase a system's CRL to a more "
         'desirable level. "In an era of scarce resources, the CRL model can '
         'help stakeholders make informed decisions and prioritize cyber '
         'spending on the most impactful solutions," said Keffer. To date, '
         'Lockheed Martin has used model-based assessments on several of its '
         'own systems across multiple domains and plans to conduct at least 10 '
         'CRL assessments by the end of 2019. To learn more about CRL and how '

         "hours and 40 minutes after the rocket's successful 6:13 a.m. ET "
         'liftoff. AEHF-5 completes a geostationary ring of five satellites '
         'delivering global coverage for survivable, highly secure and '
         'protected communications for strategic command and tactical '
         'warfighters operating on ground, sea and air platforms. Besides U.S. '
         'forces, AEHF also serves international partners including Canada , '
         'the Netherlands and the United Kingdom . "This fifth satellite adds '
         'an additional layer of flexibility for critical strategic and '
         'tactical protected communications serving the warfighter. This added '
         'resilience to the existing constellation will help ensure '

         'Communications at Lockheed Martin Space.\xa0"In the weeks ahead, '
         'AEHF-5 will move towards its operational orbit, deploy all of its '
         'solar arrays and antennas, and turn on its powerful communications '
         'payload for a rigorous testing phase prior to hand over to the Air '
         'Force." AEHF-5, with its advanced Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform '
         "technology, adds to the constellation's high-bandwidth network. One "
         'AEHF satellite provides greater total capacity than the entire '
         'legacy five-satellite Milstar communications\xa0constellation. '
         '"Individual data rates increase five-fold compared to Milstar, '
         'permitting transmission of tactical military communications, such as '
         'real-time video, battlefield maps and targeting data," said '
         'Cacheiro. "AEHF affords national leaders anti-jam, always-on '

         'strategic and tactical users to communicate globally across a '
         'high-speed network that delivers protected communications in any '

         "--\xa0The Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Long Range Discrimination "
         'Radar (LRDR) program has completed delivery of its first radar panel '
         'to Clear, Alaska and placement of the final beam on the radar '
         'shelter as the program continues to successfully achieve all '
         'milestones and work towards delivery to the Missile Defense Agency '
         '(MDA) in 2020 at its Clear, Alaska site. The radar system will serve '
         "as a critical sensor within MDA's layered defense strategy to "
         'protect the U.S. homeland from ballistic missile attacks. On the '
         'heels of completing System Technology Readiness Level 7 testing in '
         'December 2018 , the LRDR program has been steadily ramping up to '
         'full-rate manufacturing. "Completion of Technology Readiness Level 7 '
         'testing provided Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and the MDA customer '
         'confidence that the program was ready to ramp up production of the '
         'radar," said Chandra Marshall , director of Lockheed Martin\'s MDA '
         'Radars. "Lockheed Martin utilized production representative '
         'hardware, as well as tactical back end processing and software in '
         'our Solid State Radar Integration Site (SSRIS) to successfully '
         'demonstrate system performance in an operational environment in '
         '2018." Lockheed Martin invested in this state-of-the-art radar '
         'facility to reduce risk to execution of the LRDR program. LRDR '
         'combines proven solid state radar (SSR) technologies with proven '
         'ballistic missile defense algorithms, all based upon an open '
         'architecture platform capable of meeting future growth. "Solid state '
         'radar is the cornerstone of our current and future radar '
         'development," said Dr. Rob Smith , vice president and general '
         'manager of Radar and Sensors Systems at Lockheed Martin. First Radar '
         'Panel Arrives in Alaska The LRDR program successfully manufactured '
         "and shipped the system's first radar panel to Clear Air Force "
         "Station in Alaska . The 5,000-mile trip began at Lockheed Martin's "
         'facility in Moorestown, N.J. The panel, which is approximately 27 '
         'feet tall, left the site via truck. The panel is just one of 20 that '
         'will be shipped to Alaska in the coming months as manufacturing and '
         'construction of the radar site continue to progress on schedule. The '
         "panels will make up the radar's two antenna faces, both "
         'approximately four stories high and wide. The installation and '
         'integration of the radar system will begin this year followed by the '
         'transition to the testing period. LRDR Construction Milestone '
         'Construction of the framework for the facility in Clear, Alaska , '
         'which will house the radar system, has been completed. The final '
         'beam, painted in red, white and blue, was installed in June. '
         'Approximately 1,800 tons of steel will be used to build the '
         'facility. "Crews from Lockheed Martin, Haskell Davis Joint Venture '
         'and local Alaskan contractors have worked through challenging '
         'conditions, including sub-zero temperatures, in constructing the '
         'radar facility," said Marshall. "We\'ve made the necessary safety '
         "accommodations so that our team remains on schedule to ensure LRDR's "
         'critical capabilities will be delivered to MDA to defend the '
         'homeland." LRDR will provide around-the-clock threat acquisition, '
         'tracking and discrimination data to enable defense systems to lock '
         'on and engage ballistic missile threats. Lockheed Martin Missile '
         'Defense The LRDR program is built upon S-Band radar technology and '
         'is the latest in a long line of S-Band radars developed by Lockheed '
         'Martin, including the Aegis Combat System, Space Fence and Aegis '
         'Ashore.\xa0Lockheed Martin has demonstrated its commitment to '
         'advancing SSR technology and addressing emerging and evolving '
         'threats. In 2018, the Missile Defense Agency awarded the company a '
         'contract to design, manufacture and construct the Homeland Defense '
         'Radar for Hawaii . As a proven world leader in systems integration '
         'and development of air and missile defense systems and technologies, '
         'Lockheed Martin delivers high-quality missile defense solutions  '
         'that protect citizens, critical assets and deployed forces from '

         'Q-53 system by utilizing recent next-generation technology '
         'insertions already available in the radar. About the Q-53 The '

         'detecting, classifying, tracking and identifying the location of '
         'enemy indirect fire in either 90 or 360-degree modes. The Q-53 has '
         'protected warfighters around the world since 2010. Lockheed Martin '

 'text': 'KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. , July 20, 2019 / PRNewswire / --\xa0The '
         'goal of humans again walking on the Moon is one giant leap closer. '
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has completed building the capsule for '
         "NASA's Orion spacecraft . The crew module capsule for the uncrewed "
         'Artemis 1 mission to the Moon has been stacked on top of the Orion '
         'service module, which was also recently finished. Vice President '
         'Mike Pence made the announcement today at a ceremony in front of the '
         'Orion spacecraft in the aptly-named Neil Armstrong Operations and '
         'Checkout Building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . The event '
         'and announcement commemorated the 50-year anniversary of the Apollo '
         "11 Moon landing. Lockheed Martin's President, Chairman and CEO "
         'Marillyn Hewson also provided remarks at the ceremony, in addition '
         "to NASA's Administrator Jim Bridenstine , Kennedy Space Center's "
         "Director Robert Cabana and Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis . The "
         'Orion spacecraft is like none other in its design and capability. '
         '"Orion is a new class of spaceship, uniquely designed for '
         'long-duration deep space flight, that will return astronauts to the '
         'Moon and eventually take the first humans to Mars, and bring them '
         'all back safely." said Lisa Callahan , vice president and general '
         'manager of Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed Martin. "Orion will '
         'accelerate scientific discovery of our solar system and will be the '
         'cornerstone of the defining space achievement of this era." Since '
         'the crew module pressure vessel arrived in Florida , technicians and '
         'engineers from Lockheed Martin, NASA and supporting contractors have '
         'meticulously assembled the capsule into its finished state. The work '
         "included installing the capsule's avionic computers, harnesses, "
         'propulsion system and its 12 engines, 11 parachutes, its large '
         '16-foot-diameter heat shield, forward bay cover and numerous other '
         'systems and components. "Throughout assembly, the team tested and '
         'validated the many systems a hundred different ways to ensure they '
         'will operate as designed in the harshness of deep space," said Mike '
         'Hawes , Orion program manager for Lockheed Martin. "The Artemis 1 '
         'flight will test the design and workmanship of the capsule and its '
         'service module during the three-week mission out around the Moon and '
         "back. We're excited for this mission as it paves the way for the "
         'first crewed mission in 2022, Artemis 2." The crew module and '
         'service module were stacked together earlier in the week in the '
         'Final Assembly and System Testing (FAST) cell where they are now '
         'being fully integrated, including connecting the physical retention '
         'bolts and the umbilical lines between the two modules. The FAST cell '
         'is also where the Apollo spacecraft were integrated. The combined '
         'stack will then be powered up and undergo a series of integrated '
         'systems tests. In September, the combined stack will be shipped to '
         "NASA's Plum Brook Station in Ohio , where it will go through "
         'environmental testing in a large thermal vacuum chamber as well as '
         'testing for electromagnetic interference and compatibility. Once '
         'Orion returns to Kennedy at the end of the year, the spacecraft will '
         'go through final preparations before Lockheed Martin delivers it to '
         'ground systems for launch processing in early 2020. More information '

         'pension cost of approximately $2,565 million and expected financial '
         'accounting standards (FAS) pension expense of approximately $1,090 '
         'million. CAS pension cost and the service cost component of FAS '
         'pension expense is included in operating profit as part of cost of '
         'sales. The non-service cost components of FAS pension expense are '
         "included in other non-operating expense, net in the corporation's "

         'typically does not update its outlook for proposed changes in law, '
         'the above includes the effect of recently proposed tax regulations '
         'confirming that foreign military sales (FMS) qualify for tax '
         'deductions for foreign derived intangible income. The corporation '

         "consolidation. Operating profit of the corporation's business "

         'equity method investees as the operating activities of the investees '
         'are closely aligned with the operations of its business segments. '
         "Operating profit of the corporation's business segments also "
         'excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment described below, a portion '
         'of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to '
         'contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. '
         'government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition '
         'regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of '
         "management's evaluation of segment operating performance such as a "
         'portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and '
         'settlements, environmental costs, stock-based compensation expense, '
         'retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset '
         'impairments, gains or losses from significant divestitures, and '
         'other miscellaneous corporate activities. The corporation recovers '
         'CAS pension cost through the pricing of its products and services on '
         'U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension '
         "cost in each of its business segment's net sales and cost of sales. "
         "The corporation's consolidated financial statements must present "
         'pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in '
         'accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles '
         '(referred to as FAS pension expense). The operating portion of the '
         'net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the '
         'service cost component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. '
         'The non-service FAS pension cost component is included in other '
         "non‑operating expense, net on the corporation's consolidated "
         'statements of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases '
         'or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense '
         '(both service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating '
         'profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume '
         'refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit '
         'resulting from varying production activity or service levels on '
         'individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are '
         'typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular '
         "contract. In addition, comparability of the corporation's segment "
         'sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted '
         'favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the '
         "corporation's contracts for which it recognizes revenue over time "
         'using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure '
         'progress towards completion. Increases in profit booking rates, '
         'typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to '
         'revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance '
         'obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular '
         'contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may '
         'deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs '
         'to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit '
         'booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are '
         'recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date '
         'effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also '
         'be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or '
         'may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive '
         'resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and '
         'restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of '
         'assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of '
         'contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant '
         'severance actions which are excluded from segment operating results; '
         'reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on '
         "sales of certain assets. The corporation's consolidated net "
         'adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate '
         'adjustments, represented approximately 27 percent of total segment '
         'operating profit in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to 32 '

 'text': 'FORT WORTH, Texas , July 24, 2019 / PRNewswire / --\xa0The F-35 '
         'Joint Program Office, U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'have started integrating the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance '
         'System (Auto-GCAS) on to Air Force F-35As in the fleet. Leveraging a '
         'rapid, agile development, test and contracting approach, the joint '
         'government and industry team successfully fielded the life-saving '
         'technology seven years earlier than previously planned. "This is a '
         'great day for the warfighter as the Auto-GCAS is a proven system '
         'that is long overdue," said Lt. Gen. Eric Fick , F-35 Program '
         'Executive Officer. "Expediting this life-saving technology into the '
         'F-35 across the global fleet will bring more warfighters home. Over '
         'the service life of the F-35 fleet, having Auto-GCAS is estimated to '
         'prevent more than 26 ground collisions from happening. It is indeed '
         'a remarkable achievement in aeronautics which will improve the '
         'performance, efficiency, and safety of the F-35. The time and effort '
         'expended to deliver this critical warfighting capability is worth it '
         '– it will save lives." Originally developed for the F-16 in '
         'partnership with NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory, '
         'Auto-GCAS uses terrain mapping, geolocation and automation to detect '
         'and avoid potential ground collisions. When the program recognizes '
         'imminent impact, it will prompt the pilot to take action. If the '
         'pilot is unresponsive, Auto-GCAS assumes temporary control to divert '
         "the aircraft out of harm's way, and then returns control of the "
         'aircraft to the pilot once on a safe trajectory. The system has been '
         'operating successfully aboard the F-16 for more than five years and '
         "has already been credited with saving eight F-16 pilots' lives since "
         '2014. "Early integration of Auto GCAS in the F-35 is bringing game '
         'changing safety capability to a rapidly growing fleet.\xa0 It '
         "couldn't have come at a better time as we near full rate production "
         'resulting in more aircraft and pilots exposed to rigorous missions," '
         "said Lt. Col. Darren Wees of the Air Force's F-35 Integration "
         'Office. "Many thanks to the tenacious efforts of many organizations, '
         'primarily the Air Force Research Lab, Air Force Test Center, '
         'Lockheed Martin and the F-35 Joint Program Office who made this a '
         'technical reality, as well as the U.S. services and F-35 Partner '
         'Nations that ensured its inclusion in the program.\xa0These efforts '
         'have already saved lives and aircraft in the F-16, and will save '
         'lives in the F-35." Auto-GCAS was originally slated for delivery in '
         'the 2026 timeframe. To accelerate the technology, Air Force Research '
         'Laboratory and Lockheed Martin conducted positive feasibility '
         'studies and the F-35 Joint Program Office and Lockheed Martin then '
         'implemented an agile approach to develop the technology for '
         'integration on the F-35. The 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force '
         'Base then completed a rigorous flight testing program to validate '
         "its performance and safety, which led to the wing's formal "
         'recommendation to field Auto-GCAS aboard the F-35. "The F-35 is the '
         'most survivable fighter jet in the world today – and the addition of '
         'Auto-GCAS will further enhance safety and save lives," said Greg '
         "Ulmer , Lockheed Martin's vice president and general manager of the "
         'F-35 program. "The safe and effective acceleration of this '
         'technology is a testament to the joint government and industry team '
         'partnering in an agile environment to deliver life-saving capability '
         'to our men and women in uniform, significantly sooner than planned." '
         'U.S. Air Force F-35As are the first to receive Auto-GCAS, and the '
         'system will next be integrated aboard the F-35B and F-35C '
         'variants.\xa0The Auto-GCAS team was recently recognized with the '
         "National Aeronautic Associations' 2018 Robert J. Collier Trophy , "
         'and received the prestigious award in June 2019 . With stealth '
         'technology, advanced sensors, supersonic speed, weapons capacity and '
         'superior range, the F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and '
         "connected aircraft in the world. More than a fighter jet, the F-35's "
         'ability to collect, analyze and share data, is a powerful force '
         'multiplier that enhances all airborne, surface and ground-based '
         'assets in the battlespace enabling men and women in uniform to '

 'text': 'KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. , July 2, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- The '
         "critical launch abort system for NASA's Orion spacecraft was put to "
         'its hardest test today, and it demonstrated its capability to pull '
         'the crew module and future astronauts to safety during a launch if '
         'there is an emergency. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)\xa0designed and '
         'built the launch abort system for the test and is also the prime '
         'contractor building the Orion spacecraft for NASA. The Ascent '
         'Abort-2 flight test is a major test milestone that is enabling the '
         'safe passage of astronauts aboard Orion on the Artemis missions to '
         'the Moon and then Mars. During the test this morning from Cape '
         'Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida , the Orion launch abort '
         'system, with a mock-up Orion capsule, was launched on a modified '
         'Peacekeeper missile. At 31,000 feet, or about six miles up, into the '
         'flight, the on-board computers initiated the abort sequence. The '
         'launch abort motors, generating 400,000 pounds of thrust, then '
         'pulled the Orion capsule away from the rocket which was already '
         'traveling nearly 1,000 mph. Using its attitude control motor, the '
         'abort system then reoriented itself and jettisoned the Orion capsule '
         'using its jettison motor. The total test took less than three '
         'minutes. "The test flight performed perfectly, not to mention it was '
         'really exciting to watch," said Mike Hawes , Orion program manager '
         'for Lockheed Martin Space. "Hopefully this will be the last time we '
         'see this launch abort system ever work, but this test brings '
         'confidence that if needed on future Orion missions, it will safely '
         'pull the crew module and astronauts away from a life threatening '
         'event during launch." The Orion launch abort system is the highest '
         'thrust and acceleration escape system ever developed and is the only '
         "system of its kind in the world. It's a major system that makes the "
         'Orion exploration-class spaceship the safest spacecraft ever built. '
         'This is the second time the Orion launch abort system has been put '
         'to the test. The first flight test was in 2010 simulating a static '
         'abort from the launch pad. AA-2 is the final test and demonstration '
         "of the full-up launch abort system. NASA's Orion spacecraft for the "
         'uncrewed Artemis 1 mission to the Moon is being developed at the '
         'NASA Kennedy Space Center and will soon head into environmental '
         'testing—all in preparation for a 2020 launch. About Lockheed Martin '

 'text': 'VALLEY FORGE, Pa., Jul. 17, 2019 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), Ball '
         'Aerospace, and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: '
         'KTOS) were awarded a $7.2 million prototype agreement by the Defense '
         'Innovation Unit to develop a new Multi-Band, Multi-Mission (MBMM) '
         'prototype phased array as part of a broader initiative to modernize '
         'the existing Air Force Satellite Control Network and bring new '
         'technology faster to warfighters. MBMM enables multiple satellites '
         'to simultaneously connect with a single array antenna over multiple '
         'frequencies, a significant performance improvement compared to '
         'traditional single contact parabolic dishes.  The Lockheed Martin '
         'team is building prototype transmit and receive electronically '
         'steerable arrays (ESA). Each array uses Ball’s advanced phased array '
         'technologies and supports L- and S-band frequencies initially. '
         'Signal processing is accomplished with Kratos’ digital intermediate '
         'frequency (IF) technology and cloud-enabled quantumRadio.  “MBMM is '
         'a smarter way to quickly and affordably scale satellite transmission '
         'while lowering long-term maintenance costs for the Air Force,” said '
         'Maria Demaree, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin '
         'Mission Solutions. “Today, when a parabolic antenna goes down, it '
         'can take days to repair; with MBMM, it will take hours and won’t '
         'take the entire site offline – that’s a tremendous advantage.”  '
         'Extensive industry research comparing the costs of parabolic '
         'antennas to phased arrays over time show that while parabolic '
         'antennas have a lower upfront cost, they become much more expensive '
         'to maintain. Phased arrays avoid the mechanical maintenance and '
         'keyhole effects of parabolic antennas while providing graceful '
         'degradation and electronic agility in matching aperture performance '
         'to constellation demands.  “One electronically steered antenna can '
         'replace multiple dishes, enabling better performance, connectivity '
         'and affordability,” said Rob Freedman, vice president and general '
         'manager, Tactical Solutions, Ball Aerospace.  “Software modems '
         'deployed in virtual machines gives MBMM an advantage because it is '
         'easy to scale signal processing on a much faster timeline than '
         'previously,” said Frank Backes, senior vice president of Kratos '
         'Federal Space.  Future operational MBMM systems will offer new cyber '
         'resilience while reducing long-term sustainment costs for the Air '
         'Force. MBMM may eventually support multiple orbits from LEO to GEO '
         'and can perform multiple missions at the same time, including '
         'command & control (C2), launch pad and ascent operations, radar and '
         'mission data transmission. The Lockheed Martin/Ball team is one of '

         'consortium, an MBDA Deutschland and Lockheed Martin joint venture, '
         'has submitted its proposal to the German Federal Office of '
         'Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support '
         '(BAAINBw) to develop, test and deliver TLVS, Germany’s future '
         'Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) system.  The tender '
         'proposes an efficient four-phased approach that includes '
         'development, integration, testing and delivery of a fielded '
         'multi-mission system. The fielded unit will deliver new capabilities '
         'and significant performance enhancements well beyond the MEADS '
         'program and all known systems.  “A brief glance at the headlines '
         'show significant advances in adversarial threats in just the last '
         'five years, and we are operating in an environment today where those '
         'threats will likely only continue to proliferate,” said Dietmar '
         'Thelen,\xa0managing\xa0director of the TLVS joint venture. “Germany '
         'needs a future-proof solution that can grow with the emerging '
         'threat.” Designed to replace Germany’s aging, sectored Patriot '
         'systems designed in the late 1960s, the 2019 TLVS proposal provides '
         'protection from a broader threat spectrum with two mission-specific '
         'effectors, significantly enhanced radar capabilities for long range '
         'engagements and a new communications system to support enhanced '
         'interoperability, data fusion and cyber resilience. TLVS will be the '
         'first-ever integrated air and missile defense system able to '
         'simultaneously detect, track and intercept multiple threat sets, '
         'including medium and short range threats, with full 360-degree '
         'coverage. “We’ve completely reimagined TLVS based on customer '
         'requirements. Our approach reduces risk, supports lower life cycle '
         'costs and enables more effective coalition operations,” said '
         'Gregory\xa0Kee,\xa0managing\xa0director of the TLVS joint venture. '
         '“TLVS will allow Germany to provide regional protection as the '
         'Framework Nation for Air and Missile Defense for NATO, with a high '
         'degree of system sovereignty.” The TLVS proposal represents the '
         'beginning of a new chapter in the longstanding partnership between '
         'MBDA Deutschland and Lockheed Martin. With its integrated plug and '
         'fight interface, TLVS is the most advanced, networked 360-degree '
         'coverage IAMD system in the world. It is the only system with the '
         'ability to adapt to evolving threats using capabilities that are '
         'tailored to the mission. TLVS will transform\xa0Germany’s defense '
         'capabilities and set an important precedent in how neighboring '
         'nations address persistent global threats for years to come. About '

 'text': 'PARIS , June 18, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- Through ongoing '
         'modernization to the command, control, battle management and '
         "communications (C2BMC) system, Lockheed Martin's (NYSE: LMT) team "
         "has significantly enhanced the Missile Defense Agency's Ballistic "
         'Missile Defense System. Part of this C2BMC modernization is an '
         'engage on remote capability that enables the Aegis Weapon System to '
         'engage threats based on information provided entirely from C2BMC '
         'remote sensor and track data. Operationally fielded in 2004, C2BMC '
         'enables warfighters at all levels to systematically plan ballistic '
         'missile defense operations, collectively see the battle develop and '
         'dynamically manage designated networked sensors and weapons. Fielded '
         'in fiscal year 2019 to the U.S. European and U.S. Central Commands, '
         "C2BMC's engage on remote capability supports the European Phased "
         'Adaptive Approach Phase III milestone, which is designed to protect '
         'U.S. deployed forces and NATO allies in Europe from ballistic '
         'missile attacks. "Engage on remote provides an additional layer of '
         'defense by providing more time to react to threats," said Steve '
         'Froelich , director of Missile Defense Solutions at Lockheed Martin. '
         '"It is through C2BMC, and its connection to the many elements of the '
         'Ballistic Missile Defense System, that we provide our forces with an '
         'advanced, truly integrated missile defense capability." Preceding '
         "its deployment to the combatant commands, C2BMC's engage on remote "
         'capability was successfully demonstrated as part of a Missile '
         'Defense Agency flight test in December 2018 , where the Aegis Weapon '
         'System utilized remote sensor data provided by C2BMC to plan, launch '
         'and engage a missile without detecting the target with the organic '
         'Aegis radar. Using its ground, air and space-based command and '
         'control architecture, C2BMC detected the threat, tracked the missile '
         'through its connection to ballistic missile defense radars, locked '
         'onto the target, then relayed the target location to the Aegis '
         'system. By enabling Aegis interceptors to conduct operations based '
         'entirely on off-board radar information, C2BMC greatly expands the '
         'range of the Aegis systems. Of the successful test, former MDA '
         'director Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves said, "FTI-03 demonstrated the '
         'effectiveness of the European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase III '
         'architecture. It also showcased the significance of C2BMC to the '
         'future of integrated multi-domain missile defense operations." For '

 'text': 'DENVER , June 19, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'has been selected to design dual small deep space spacecraft to '
         'visit near-earth asteroids in a mission called Janus, led by the '
         "University of Colorado Boulder . One of NASA's Small Innovative "
         'Mission for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) finalists, Janus is '
         'designed to fly by two binary asteroids, or asteroids orbiting a '
         'common center of mass, to image the system using both visible and '
         'infrared cameras. These small satellites will launch in 2022 to '
         'reach the asteroid system in 2026. "We are excited to partner with '
         'University of Colorado on this challenging mission to be among the '
         'first small sats to return science data from beyond Earth orbit," '
         'said Chris McCaa , Janus program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. '
         '"Janus will provide the opportunity to blend our long heritage of '
         'mission success in deep space with the small sat paradigm, helping '
         'to pave the way for a new generation of deep space explorers. '
         'Combining our track record of delivering on principal '
         'investigator-led missions and the caliber of this science team will '
         'give us all a greater understanding of the working of our Solar '
         'System." Downselected for this next phase of NASA\'s SIMPLEx '
         'program, Lockheed Martin will be working toward preliminary design '
         'review. SIMPLEx is a cost-capped program focusing science '
         'investigations on any Solar System body, except for the Earth and '
         'the Sun, using small spacecraft lighter than 180 kg. The Janus '
         'mission is designed to meet these requirements. The mission will '
         'investigate how binary asteroids form and evaluate existing theories '
         'of how these constantly changing systems evolve. Deep space missions '
         'present challenges beyond what the typical small sat mission '
         'encounters in low-Earth orbit. For example, power systems must '
         'handle a range of Sun distances and telecommunication systems need '
         'to be able to transmit over long distances and be compatible with '
         'the Deep Space Network. Lockheed Martin brings the experience of '
         'deep space exploration system integration into the design of these '
         'ESPA-class, dual small satellites weighing in at about 40 kg each. '
         '"All deep space missions require a balance of reliability and '
         'schedule assurance to be successful and, unlike a mission to '
         'low-Earth orbit, you must meet the planetary launch window. The '
         'asteroids won\'t wait for us," said McCaa. "To meet those '
         'challenges, we will be applying proven methods from missions such as '
         'OSIRIS-REx and Lucy as well as leveraging lessons learned while '
         'developing other small sat missions such as LunIR." The Janus '
         'mission is led by Principal Investigator Dan Scheeres of University '
         'of Colorado Boulder in Boulder, Colorado . If selected in the final '
         'stage, Lockheed Martin Space will design and build the spacecraft '
         'and provide mission operations after launch. Malin Space Science '
         'Systems will provide the instrument suite including visible and '
         'infrared cameras. The selected investigations will be managed by the '

         'ships are designed to operate in more areas than a typical Navy '
         'ship, including shallow water near the coastline," said the ship\'s '
         'sponsor and Northfield, Minnesota native Deputy Undersecretary of '
         'the Navy Jodi Greene. "Consequently, LCS 21 is going to bring the '
         'name \'Minneapolis- Saint Paul \' all around the globe." Lockheed '
         'Martin is in full-rate production and has delivered eight ships to '
         'the U.S. Navy. There are eight ships in various stages of production '
         'and test. This year, Lockheed Martin and Fincantieri Marinette '
         'Marine will begin construction on two ships, deliver two ships, '
         'complete sea trials for two ships and see three ships commissioned '
         '(LCS 13, 15 and 17). "We take great pride in building the future USS '
         'Minneapolis- Saint Paul and all of the freedom variant ships," said '

         'the ground up! On May 22 , Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) delivered the '
         'GPS III Contingency Operations (COps) software upgrade to the U.S. '
         "Air Force's current GPS ground control system. The upgrade will "
         'enable the Air Force to start commanding the new, next-generation '
         'GPS III satellites now coming off the production line and beginning '
         'to launch. And the new GPS III satellites are coming. The first GPS '
         'III satellite launched in December 2018 ; the second GPS III shipped '
         'to Cape Canaveral in March for a July launch; and the Air Force, on '
         'May 17 , declared the third new GPS III "Available for Launch" next. '
         'The challenge was modernizing the current ground system – formally '
         'known as the GPS Architecture Evolution Plan Operational Control '
         'System (AEP OCS) -- to fly the legacy constellation, as well as the '
         'new, modern GPS III satellites, until the next generation '
         'Operational Control System (OCX) Block 1, still in development, is '
         'delivered. To address this, in 2016, the Air Force contracted '
         'Lockheed Martin to develop the GPS III COps program. Currently, the '
         'AEP OCS controls 31 GPS IIA, IIR, IIR-M and IIF satellites launched '
         "between 1993-2016. With the AEP OCS' new GPS III COps upgrade, the "
         'Air Force will be able to command and control both the legacy '
         'satellites, as well the more powerful GPS III satellites. '
         '"Positioning, Navigation and Timing is a critical mission for our '
         'nation and COps will allow the Air Force to gain early access to its '
         'new GPS III satellites," said Johnathon Caldwell , Lockheed '
         'Martin\'s vice president for Navigation Systems. "We just finished '
         'Final Qualification Testing and delivery on COps, and it will be '
         'integrated and installed on the AEP OCS over the summer. We look '
         "forward to the Air Force 'flying' a GPS constellation on the COps "
         'OCS which includes the new GPS III satellites, later this year." '
         'Meanwhile, the first GPS III space vehicle (GPS III SV01), launched '
         'in December 2018 , is finishing up pre-operational on-orbit '
         'check-out. It continues to be controlled by OCX Block 0 software '
         "installed at Lockheed Martin's GPS III Launch and Checkout Center at "
         "the company's Denver facility. GPS III SV01 is expected to be "
         '"handed over" to the COps OCS later this year after the legacy '
         'constellation is moved over to the updated AEP OCS. Lockheed Martin '
         'has sustained the AEP OCS since 2013. In November 2018 , the company '
         'completed the AEP 7.5 upgrade -- the largest architectural change in '
         'the systems history -- replacing significant code, hardware and '
         "software to improve the system's cybersecurity capabilities and "
         'positioning the Air Force to better operate in contested, degraded '
         'and operationally limited environments. In December 2018 ,  the Air '
         'Force awarded Lockheed Martin the GPS Control Segment Sustainment II '
         '(GCS II) contract to continue to further modernize and sustain the '
         'AEP OCS through 2025. In 2020, the AEP OCS is expected to receive '
         'the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) upgrade, which will allow control of '
         'M-Code, an advanced,\xa0new signal designed to improve anti-jamming '
         'and anti-spoofing, as well as to increase secure access to '
         'military\xa0GPS\xa0signals for U.S. and allied armed forces. '
         'Lockheed Martin is under contract to develop and build up to 32 GPS '
         'III/IIIF satellites. GPS III will deliver three times better '
         'accuracy and provide up to eight times improved anti-jamming '
         "capabilities. GPS III's new L1C civil signal will make it the first "
         'GPS satellite to be interoperable with other international global '
         'navigation satellite systems. Additional "IIIF" capabilities, '
         'beginning at the 11 th satellite, will include a fully digital '
         'navigation payload, Regional Military Protection, an '
         'accuracy-enhancing laser retroreflector array, and a Search & Rescue '
         'payload. For additional GPS III information, photos and video visit: '

         'The U.S. Air Force Space Fence system detected the breakup field '
         'from an anti-satellite test conducted by India during a scheduled '
         'endurance exercise of the new space surveillance radar. As '
         'MICROSAT-R was expected to pass through the un-cued surveillance '
         'fence, Space Fence automatically issued a "breakup alert" indicating '
         'there were multiple objects within close proximity. Space Fence '
         'observed a significant amount of debris tracks surrounding the time '
         'of the event crossing labeled as uncorrelated targets. Long-arc '
         'tracking was initiated within the orbital debris cloud to form '
         'accurate initial orbit determinations. With this information, the '
         'system was able to automatically predict and correlate the next '
         'crossing time. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)\xa0system operators then '
         'prepared for the next crossing by setting up an enhanced sensitivity '
         'task volume ahead of the normal un-cued surveillance fence to '
         'increase the low altitude track duration. Although the Space Fence '
         'is currently in its test phase and not yet operational, the Space '
         'Fence un-cued surveillance coverage showed its unique ability to '
         'observe these events unfolding at different altitudes in real time. '
         'Although the anti-satellite test was conducted at approximately 300 '
         'kilometers, the debris cloud extended beyond the original parent '
         'object orbit. "Although the Space Fence system is still under test, '
         'it continues to demonstrate its advanced capabilities providing '
         'operationally-relevant information in all orbital regimes from Low '
         'Earth Orbit through Geosynchronous Earth Orbit," said Dr. Rob Smith '
         ', vice president and general manager of Radar and Sensor Systems for '
         'Lockheed Martin. "The criticality of space assets to both national '
         'defense and the world economy cannot be understated. As multiple new '
         'mega constellations consisting of thousands of satellites become a '
         'reality and the space domain continues to become more congested, the '
         'demand for more accurate and timely space situational awareness data '
         'will be of the utmost importance to the warfighter." The Space Fence '
         'system continues to track objects from the anti-satellite event '
         'through the government-led testing phase which began in early April. '
         'Colonel Stephen Purdy , Director of the Space Superiority Systems '
         'Directorate, Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force '
         'Base, who oversees the Space Fence program said, "Space Fence is '
         'already proving itself as a capable system even before becoming '
         "operational. The Indian test showcased Space Fence's capabilities in "
         'a real-world event. The system was able to quickly respond to a '
         'highly dynamic situation providing critical data. Space Fence is the '
         'latest in a long line of capabilities we are collectively bringing '
         'to the warfighter as we continue to build out space capabilities for '
         'the United States ." About Lockheed Martin Headquartered in '

         'Das Marine Corps hat einen Bedarf von insgesamt 200 Hubschraubern '
         'dieser Klasse. „Wir freuen uns, dass das U.S. Marine Corps sich für '
         'den CH-53K entschieden hat. Der CH-53K ist der modernste, '
         'intelligenteste und leistungsfähigste verfügbare schwere '
         'Transporthubschrauber auf dem Markt und wir konnten uns in den USA '
         'einen Eindruck von den enormen Fähigkeiten des CH-53K verschaffen. '
         'Unzählige erfolgreiche Testflüge mit dem Hubschrauber sind Zeugnis '
         'für die fortgeschrittene Serienreife des Testprogramms“, so Susanne '
         'Wiegand. Der von grundauf neu entwickelte CH-53K „King Stallion“ '
         'befindet sich derzeit in einem umfassenden Testprogramm, von dem '
         'bereits mehr als 1.400 Flugstunden absolviert wurden, um einen '
         'sicheren und effektiven Betrieb zu gewährleisten, der es ermöglicht, '
         'mehr Ausrüstung über längere Strecken und größere Höhen zu bewegen '
         'als jeder andere in der Produktion befindliche schwere '
         'Transporthubschrauber. Zu den Meilensteinen im Bereich der '

 'text': 'WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. , May, 17, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- The Sikorsky '
         'HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter achieved first flight today at '
         "Sikorsky's West Palm Beach, Florida site, an important step toward "
         'bringing this all-new aircraft to service members to perform '
         'critical search and rescue operations.\xa0The aircraft, developed by '
         'Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company (NYSE: LMT) and based on the '
         "proven UH-60M Black Hawk, is customized for the U.S. Air Force 's "
         'rescue mission and will ensure the Air Force fulfills its mission to '
         'leave no one behind. View the video. Total flight time was '
         'approximately 1.2 hours and included hover control checks, low speed '
         'flight, and a pass of the airfield. "This achievement is yet another '
         'vital step toward a low rate initial production decision and getting '
         'this much-needed aircraft and its advanced capabilities to the '
         'warfighter," said Dana Fiatarone , vice president, Sikorsky Army & '
         'Air Force Systems. "We are very pleased with the results of today\'s '
         'flight and look forward to a productive and informative flight test '
         'program." Today\'s flight paves the way for a Milestone C production '
         'decision in September 2019 , per the original baseline schedule, to '
         'which both Sikorsky and the Air Force are committed. A second HH-60W '
         'helicopter is expected to enter flight test next week, with a third '
         'and fourth aircraft entering flight test this summer. These aircraft '
         'will provide critical data over the course of the program which will '
         'enable the Air Force to make an informed production decision. "The '
         "HH-60W's first flight is the culmination of significant development "
         'and design advances. We are excited to now move forward to begin '
         'full aircraft system qualification via the flight test program," '
         'said Greg Hames , director of the Combat Rescue Helicopter program. '
         '"Together with the Air Force, our team is motivated and committed to '
         'advancing this program and delivering this superior aircraft to our '
         'airmen and women." The HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter is '
         'significantly more capable and reliable than its predecessor, the '
         'HH-60G Pave Hawk. The aircraft hosts a new fuel system that nearly '
         'doubles the capacity of the internal tank on a UH-60M Black Hawk, '
         'giving the Air Force crew extended range and more capability to '
         'rescue those injured in the battle space. The HH-60W specification '
         'drives more capable defensive systems, vulnerability reduction, '
         'weapons, cyber-security, environmental, and net-centric requirements '
         'than currently held by the HH-60G. "With the Combat Rescue '
         "Helicopter's successful first flight now behind us, we look forward "
         "to completion of Sikorsky's flight test program, operational testing "
         "and production of this aircraft to support the Air Force's critical "
         'rescue mission," said Edward Stanhouse , Chief, U.S. Air Force '
         'Helicopter Program Office. "Increased survivability is key and we '
         'greatly anticipate the added capabilities this aircraft will '
         'provide." The U.S. Air Force program of record calls for 113 '
         'helicopters to replace the Pave Hawks, which perform critical combat '
         'search and rescue and personnel recovery operations for all U.S. '
         'military services. A total of nine aircraft will be built at '

         'conditions,\xa0has flown more than 1,400 test hours and has met all '
         'the outer reaches of the test envelope. The King Stallion is in the '
         'midst of a rigorous test program to ensure militaries can safely '
         'move troops and equipment at higher altitudes, quicker and more '
         'effectively than ever. The CH-53K, which has proven it can lift more '
         'than 36,000 pounds, is the most powerful heavy lift helicopter ever '
         "built in the United States . The King Stallion's technologically "
         'advanced design will meet the future warfighting requirements for '
         'decades to come, enabling missions like humanitarian aid, troop and '
         'equipment transport, casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), support of '
         'special operations forces, and combat search and rescue (CSAR). View '
         'the video highlighting CH-53K progress. View the infographic for an '
         'overview of the CH-53K. Accomplishments to date include: high '

         'areas, including entire countries. GATR uses deep learning '
         'techniques common in the commercial sector and can identify ships, '
         'airplanes, buildings, seaports, and many other categories. “There’s '
         'more commercial satellite data than ever available today, and up '
         'until now, identifying objects has been a largely manual process,” '
         'said Maria Demaree, vice president and general manager of Lockheed '
         'Martin Space Mission Solutions. “Artificial Intelligence models like '
         'GATR keep analysts in control while letting them focus on '
         'higher-level tasks.” GATR has a high accuracy rate, well over 90% on '
         'the models we’ve tested so far. It only took two hours to search the '
         'entire state of Pennsylvania for fracking sites – that’s 120,000 '
         'square kilometers “I’m not an expert on what oil production sites '
         'are, and I don’t have to be,” said Mark Pritt, senior fellow at '
         'Lockheed Martin and principle investigator for GATR. “This system '
         'teaches itself the defining characteristics of an object, saving '
         'valuable time training an algorithm and ultimately letting an image '
         'analyst focus more on their mission.” GATR builds on research '
         'Pritt’s team pioneered during a Intelligence Advanced Research '
         'Projects Activity (IARPA) challenge, called the “Functional Map of '
         'the World.” The Lockheed Martin team was the only team from a '

 'text': 'STRATFORD , Conn., June 10, 2019 -- Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin '
         'company, (NYSE: LMT) will build six production VH-92A Presidential '
         'Helicopters under a contract from the U.S Navy . These helicopters '
         'are part of the 23 aircraft program of record for the U.S. Marine '
         'Corps. Under the terms of the contract, known as\xa0Low Rate Initial '
         'Production (LRIP) Lot 1, Sikorsky will begin deliveries of six '
         'VH-92A helicopters in 2021. The remaining production aircraft will '
         'be delivered in 2022 and 2023. The contract also provides spares and '
         'training support. The contract award follows an affirmative '
         'Milestone C decision on May 30 from the U.S. Navy moving the '
         'development program into production. “The authorization to exercise '
         'the program’s first Low-Rate Initial Production lot is a testament '
         'to the hard work and dedication from the team to deliver this '
         'important asset on budget and within the planned acquisition '
         'timeline” said U.S. Marine Corps Col. Eric Ropella, PMA-274 '
         'presidential helicopter program manager. “This award is an example '
         'of acquisition done right.” Helicopter Proves Ready for Presidential '
         'Mission The VH-92A test aircraft at Patuxent River, Maryland, have '
         'proven their production readiness by undergoing rigorous U.S. '
         'government testing and operational assessments, which included '
         'operating on the south lawn of the White House. The VH-92A has flown '
         'over 520 flight test hours establishing the aircraft’s technical '
         'maturity and readiness of its mission systems. “This production '
         'decision validates the modifications to Sikorsky’s most successful '
         'commercial helicopter making it capable to transport the President '
         'of the United States at anytime, anywhere around the world,” said '
         'Dave Banquer, Sikorsky VH-92A program director. “Sikorsky has been '
         'building and providing helicopter transportation for every U.S. '
         'President and Commander in Chief since Dwight D. Eisenhower. We are '
         'excited to build the next generation of transport with the VH-92A '
         'helicopter.” Prepared for Production The VH-92A aircraft will '
         'provide safe, reliable and capable transportation for the President, '
         'Vice President and foreign heads of state. This program ensures long '
         'term affordability and maintainability by utilizing the FAA '
         'certified S-92 aircraft which has industry leading reliability and '
         'availability. The S-92 fleet surpassed 1.5 million flight hours in '
         'April and averages 14,600 hours of safe flight per month. Sikorsky '
         'and the U.S. Navy integrate mature mission and communication systems '
         'into the aircraft. This aircraft provides communication capability '
         'to perform the duties of Commander in Chief, Head of State and Chief '
         'Executive. First Training System Delivered Lockheed Martin delivered '
         'and installed the first VH-92A training device at the Presidential '
         'Helicopter Squadron HMX-1 in Quantico, Virginia, earlier this year. '
         'Marine pilots, avionics technicians and squadron personnel are '
         'actively engaged in hands-on learning through the suite of devices. '
         'The Flight Training Device (FTD) is a replica of the VH-92A cockpit '
         'to give pilots mission-oriented flight training in a '
         'simulation-based training device. The training suite allows '

 'text': 'BERLIN May 27 , 2019 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: '
         'LMT), formally responded to the German Air Force "Schwerer '
         'Transporthubschrauber" (STH) Program call for competition. Sikorsky '
         'expects to offer the most modern heavy lift helicopter in '
         'production, the CH-53K\xa0King Stallion , in response to the '
         'official Request for Proposals, which is expected this summer. The '
         'new STH heavy lifter will allow the Bundeswehr to move troops and '
         'equipment more quickly, safely and effectively than ever before. “ '
         'The CH-53K is the modern heavy lift solution that will provide the '
         'German Armed Forces with a safe, reliable heavy lift helicopter that '
         'can be entered into service seamlessly without need for upgrades for '
         'the next several decades. It is the only heavy lifter that will '
         'remain in production through 2032 and beyond,” said Sikorsky '
         'President Dan Schultz. “Our strong German industry team will provide '
         'sustainment and maintenance over the next 40-50 years ensuring '
         'high-quality jobs across the country for decades to come.” Sikorsky '
         'and its Germany industry partners, including Rheinmetall, remain '
         'confident that the Sikorsky CH-53K offers the best value to the '
         'Bundeswehr and offers unrivaled growth potential over its lifecycle. '
         'German partners include: Rheinmetall, MTU, ZF Luftfahrttechnik GmbH, '
         'Autoflug, HYDRO Systems KG, Collins Aerospace, Vincorion, Hensoldt, '
         'Liebherr and Rohde & Schwarz. “Sikorsky is already today in close '
         'partnerships with more than 10 leading German technology companies, '
         'including the exclusive teammates Rheinmetall, MTU, Autoflug and '
         'HYDRO,” said Susanne Wiegand, Member of the Management Board, '
         'Rheinmetall Defence. “This team is a fundamental key factor for a '
         'successful STH program, high availability rates of the helicopters '
         'and creates best added value for Germany and its industry. We are '
         'looking forward that the procurement decision will be made in favor '
         'of the CH-53K.” King Stallion Update The U.S. Marine Corps on May 17 '
         'awarded Sikorsky a contract for 12 more CH-53K aircraft. Sikorsky is '
         'now on contract for a total of 14 LRIP aircraft,\xa0plus the four '
         'development and test aircraft that will also go to the Marines, with '
         'one aircraft already delivered. The Marine Corps program of record '
         'is 200 aircraft. “We are very glad about the decision of the U.S. '
         'Marine Corps,” Wiegand said. “This sign of confidence from the U.S. '
         'government perfectly demonstrates the trust in the performance of '
         'the CH-53K. It is the most modern, intelligent and powerful '
         'available Heavy Lift Helicopter in the market and we were able to '
         'get an impression of the CH-53K’s enormous capabilities in USA. '
         'Countless successful test flights with the helicopter are approved '
         'for the advanced maturity of the test program.” The all-new CH-53K, '
         'designed to be survivable in the most difficult conditions, has '
         'flown more than 1,400 test hours and has met all the outer reaches '
         'of the test envelope. The King Stallion is in the midst of a '
         'rigorous test program to ensure safe, effective operations moving '
         'more equipment over longer distances and higher altitudes than any '
         'other heavy lift aircraft in production. Accomplishments to date '
         'include: high altitude, hot temperature,\xa0and degraded visual '

 'text': 'OWEGO, New York, May 22, 2019 – The Air Force Research Lab’s (AFRL) '
         'Advanced Power Technology Office (APTO) estimates that typical long '
         'endurance group 1 unmanned aerial systems’ (UAS) flight time lasts '
         'two hours on average. A system’s endurance, along with its payload '
         'capacity, often means life or death for the special operations '
         'forces who use them to complete a multitude of missions. That’s why '
         'AFRL worked with Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] to mature and enhance a '
         'developmental platform called Condor eXtended Endurance and Payload '
         '(XEP). Previously Condor was similar to other Group 1 systems, with '
         'a two-hour maximum of flight endurance and a standard payload bay. '
         'AFRL and Lockheed Martin overcame a series of engineering hurdles to '
         'not only improve the system’s endurance but also optimize the '
         'fuselage to accommodate multiple payload types. For endurance, the '
         'team integrated a high energy-density battery and field-oriented '
         'controller to generate optimal phasing in the motor – doubling its '
         'endurance to up to four hours of continuous flight on a single '
         'battery . For the fuselage, they redesigned the structure, so Condor '
         'can easily accommodate up to two , 6-inch payloads, uncommon for the '
         'average Group 1 UAS. It also features built-in power and '
         'communications, so an operator can add a gimbal or other '
         'non-traditional payloads. “Envision a small, handheld cargo aircraft '
         '– a simple air vehicle with huge payload potential,” said Ryan '
         'Gagnon, program manager for Lockheed Martin’s Small Unmanned Aerial '
         'Systems team. “Couple that with increased endurance, now special '
         'forces, especially small tactical units, can have group 2 UAS '
         'capabilities in a more portable and affordable solution.” In '
         'addition to long endurance and customizable payload options, Condor '
         'has several key features, including: “The Lockheed Martin and AFRL '
         'partnership has provided a field-ready, user-ready, highly advanced '
         'Group 1 SUAS.” said Ed Clark, Aviation program lead at AFRL. “This '
         'vehicle is now an industry leader.” In April 2019, the AFRL APTO '
         'office completed the acceptance test demonstration of the Condor XEP '
         'at Lockheed Martin’s Owego, New York facility. This concludes the '
         'advanced development program. However, AFRL and Lockheed Martin plan '
         'to make additional efficiency gains by integrating a hydrogen fuel '
         'cell later in the year. To learn more about Lockheed Martin’s '

 'text': 'DENVER , May 2, 2019 / PRNewswire / --\xa0Protecting against the '
         'extremes of space travel is critical to the success of any mission. '
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has successfully completed the flight '
         'hardware structure of the heat shield, validating the physical '
         'integrity with a final static test after exposing it to flight-like '
         'thermal conditions. The heat shield is half of the large and '
         'sophisticated two-part aeroshell that Lockheed Martin is designing '
         "and building to encapsulate NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Mars "
         '2020 rover from the punishing heat and friction of entry through the '
         'Martian atmosphere. The Mars 2020 mission will be one of the most '
         'challenging entry, descent and landings ever attempted on the Red '
         'Planet. The heat shield aerodynamics serve as a "brake" to slow the '
         'spacecraft from about 12,000 mph (19,300 kph) so the structure needs '
         'to be flawless. As the tenth aeroshell system that Lockheed Martin '
         'has produced for NASA, this is one of the largest at 15 feet (4.5 '
         'meters) in diameter. "Our experience building aeroshells for NASA '
         'Mars missions does not mean that it is \'easy\'," said Neil Tice , '
         'Lockheed Martin Mars 2020 Aeroshell program manager. "Tests like '
         'this structural test are absolutely essential to ensuring mission '
         'success in the long-run." The static test was conducted on April 25 '
         'and was designed to mimic the load that the heat shield will '
         'experience during the most extreme part of its journey; the entry '
         'phase. To do that, engineers used vacuum pumps to simulate the '
         'pressure of approximately 140,000 pounds on the structure. The '
         'structure was tested to 120% of the expected flight load to push it '
         'to the limit. For this particular test, the team also integrated a '
         'new form of instrumentation. Historically, this test utilizes '
         'conventional strain gauges and extensometers to monitor structural '
         'response at distinct points during loading. Partnering with NASA '
         'Langley Research Center, the team also applied a new tool called '
         'Photogrammetry or Digital Image Correlation. This allowed the team '
         'to monitor full-field strains and displacements over the entire '
         'visible area of the structure in real time. To use this technique, a '
         'vinyl wrap, similar to a decal, that has different visual cues (dark '
         'random speckles over a white background) was applied to the heat '
         'shield. During the test, a set of digital cameras optically monitor '
         'any changes in the pattern and generate a three-dimensional map of '
         'displacements and surface strains as the applied load increases. '
         '"While we have used this full-field photogrammetry technique on test '
         'articles in the past, this is the first successful implementation on '
         'official flight hardware," said Dr. Sotiris Kellas , NASA Langley '
         'aerospace engineer and lead for the technical demonstration. "This '
         'technology will allow us to safeguard hardware during testing but '
         'more importantly provide data for test analysis correlation and '
         'improvement of our design and analysis tools." Following this test, '
         'the Lockheed Martin team will apply Phenolic Impregnated Carbon '
         'Ablator (PICA) thermal protection system tiles to the structure. '
         'Once complete and through all environmental testing, the full heat '
         'shield will be mated to the backshell in early fall. The Mars 2020 '

         'shipped the Air Force’s fifth Advanced Extremely High Frequency '
         '(AEHF-5) satellite to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ahead of its '
         'expected June launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. '
         'AEHF-5’s launch comes just eight months after AEHF-4 blasted off '
         'from the Cape on Oct. 17, 2018. Once launched, AEHF-5 will join the '
         'AEHF constellation, which provides protected, survivable '
         'communications for the nation’s nuclear command, control and '
         'communication mission. Earlier this month, the Air Force and '
         'Lockheed Martin marked the successful completion of AEHF-4’s '
         'spacecraft on-orbit testing. This event is the last step before the '
         'satellite joins the existing AEHF constellation, adding increased '
         'resiliency to an on-orbit network that continues to provide '
         'highly-secure, protected and survivable communications for the U.S., '
         'Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. “We are thrilled to '
         'return to the Cape to launch AEHF-5 less than a year after launching '
         'AEHF-4, showing an accelerated pace to support the Air Force Space '
         'and Missiles Systems Center,” said Mike Cacheiro, vice president of '
         'Protected Communications at Lockheed Martin Space. “AEHF-4 arrived '
         'to its on-orbit operational position a month early, where it '
         'demonstrated Extended Data Rate (XDR) connectivity. This is an '
         'exciting time where we are witnessing the deployment of critical '
         'capabilities of the current four AEHF satellites in geosynchronous '
         'orbit, which provide ten times greater capacity than the original '
         'Milstar constellation. The AEHF system is essentially a high '
         'capacity data network in the sky, and this is a complete paradigm '
         'shift for the future of protected communications.” The new AEHF '
         'constellation with the advanced technology of XDR will change how '
         'users interact with the new high-bandwidth network. Data speeds '
         'increase fivefold, and transmissions that used to take hours can '
         'take minutes. This enables both strategic and tactical users to '

         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) is part of an industry team behind an infrared '
         '(IR) camera that BP plc group businesses are using to manage methane '
         'emissions at oil and gas production facilities ranging from Alaska '
         'to Angola . Those facilities use flaring – the controlled burning of '
         'gas during oil and gas production – to eliminate hydrocarbons that '
         'cannot be recovered or recycled. Some unburnt methane, the main '
         'component of natural gas and a potent greenhouse gas, can escape '
         "into the environment. It's important to measure and manage these "
         "emissions, and the industry team's video imaging spectral radiometry "
         '(VISR) flare monitor uses IR images to measure how efficiently the '
         'flare consumes emissions. The VISR flare monitor is the first '
         'readily deployable monitoring solution that directly measures '
         'methane emissions entering the environment. BP has used the camera '
         'at production sites in Alaska and Angola and is dispatching them to '
         'four additional facilities this year. "Inefficiencies in flaring is '
         'a potential source of methane entering the atmosphere," said Peter '
         'Evans , BP Environmental Engineering Lead. "BP is determined to '
         'tackle such greenhouse gas emissions and help deliver a cleaner, '
         'better energy future. The VISR flare monitor enables us to do that, '
         'by helping us identify opportunities for real sustainable reductions '
         'in methane emissions." The VISR flare monitor is manufactured by a '
         'three-company team. Lockheed Martin manufactures the IR sensor at '
         'its Santa Barbara Focalplane facility in Calif., leveraging '
         'technology developed for advanced tactical fighter jets. Surface '
         'Optics designed the VISR multispectral camera and manufactures the '
         'system, and team lead Providence Photonics provides software that '
         'analyzes the IR imagery and optimizes flare performance. In addition '
         'to monitoring flare stacks, these cameras can help to continuously '
         'optimize combustion as part of a permanent system and maintain flare '
         'compliance with applicable regulations such as U.S. Environmental '
         'Protection Agency requirements. For example, increasing combustion '
         'efficiency from 96.5 to 98 percent yields a 40 percent reduction in '
         'hydrocarbon emissions. About Lockheed Martin Headquartered in '

 'text': 'ATHENS , Greece, May 17, 2019 – Representatives from the Hellenic '
         'Navy, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Hellenic Aerospace Industry '
         '(HAI) hosted a ceremony on today at HAI’s facility near Athens, '
         'Greece,\xa0for the delivery of the first P-3B maritime patrol '
         'aircraft (interim solution aircraft) as part of the Hellenic Navy '
         'P-3B maritime patrol aircraft mid-life upgrade and modernization '
         'program implementation. The event was attended by senior leaders '
         'from the Greek government and the Hellenic ministry of National '
         'Defense, the Hellenic Navy and Air Force, as well as representatives '
         'from the U.S. Embassy in Athens, Lockheed Martin and HAI. Local '
         'government officials also attended the ceremony. The '
         'government-to-government agreement between the United States and '
         'Greece was announced in 2015, providing for the re-activation of one '
         'Hellenic Navy P-3B Orion maritime patrol aircraft, which is the '
         'aircraft delivered today. This agreement also includes the '
         'modernization of four Hellenic Navy P-3B aircraft through the '
         'Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU) Program.  MLU kits provide an extension of '
         'service life by 15,000 flight hours. In addition, this contract '
         'provides for phased depot maintenance; a Greece indigenous mission '
         'integration and management system; new avionics; and other ancillary '
         'hardware and services. Evangelos Apostolakis, Greece’s minister of '
         'National Defense (MoD), welcomed the delivery of the first interim '
         'solution P-3B Maritime Patrol Aircraft of the Hellenic Navy and '
         'underlined the operational benefits of their upgrading program of at '
         'a national and international level. The MoD stated that this program '
         'meets the optimal cost-effectiveness solution, underlining at the '
         'same time its contribution to the reinforcement of the domestic '
         'defense industry. The P-3 Orion is the model in maritime patrol and '
         'reconnaissance aircraft, and is used for homeland security, '
         'anti-piracy operations, humanitarian relief, search and rescue, '
         'intelligence gathering, antisubmarine warfare and, recently, to '
         'assist in air traffic control and natural disaster relief support. '
         'The Hellenic Navy operated the P-3 fleet for 15 years. “The Hellenic '
         'Navy needed enhancements and improvements for its maritime patrol '
         'aircraft. The delivery of this first aircraft will cover, initially, '
         'an operational requirement of vital importance, while the Hellenic '
         'Navy prepares for the delivery of the fully modernized P-3s in the '
         'coming years,” said Rear Adm. Nikolaos Tsounis, chief of the '
         'Hellenic Navy General Staff. Work on the Hellenic Navy P-3s is '
         'performed at HAI facilities in Greece, as well as at Lockheed '
         'Martin’s facilities in Marietta, Georgia, and Greenville, South '
         'Carolina. Lockheed Martin is the Original Equipment Manufacturer '
         '(OEM) of the P-3 Orion.  “Today we are especially proud as the '
         'delivery of this first aircraft, represents an important step in '
         'enhancing Greece’s maritime patrol capability. The P-3 MLU and '
         'Avionics Modernization Program provides state-of-the-art operational '
         'advantages to the Hellenic Navy to not only support present mission '
         'requirements, but future ones as well,” said Karmyn Norwood, vice '
         'president of International Programs for Air Mobility & Maritime '
         'Missions at Lockheed Martin. “This program also exemplifies the '
         'power of partnership, from the support of the U.S. Navy and the '
         'Hellenic Navy to the outstanding work delivered by the HAI team. '
         'Together, we provide the best resources and value to Greece.” The '
         'domestic defense industry in Greece is providing 30 percent of the '
         'overall program value, drawing considerable industrial, financial '
         'and technological benefits for the autonomous operation and support '
         'of the specific weapon system. “Through this program, the Hellenic '
         'Aerospace Industry was given the opportunity to participate in a '
         'program of high technical and operational value,” said Zacharias '
         'Gikas, chairman of the HAI Board of Directors. “HAI salutes the '
         'delivery of this first aircraft as a significant achievement in the '
         'effort for a successful program integration. HAI management and '
         'employees will continue to effectively work together in delivering '
         'the best possible results to the Hellenic government and the '
         'Hellenic Navy.” Find out more about the P-3 Orion here: '

         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) is excited to announce the successful completion '
         'of AEHF-4 spacecraft on-orbit test and available for Satellite '
         'Control Availability (SCA). The AEHF-4 on-orbit test (A4 OOT) '
         'successfully activated the payload, built by its major '
         'subcontractor, Northrop Grumman, and demonstrated that AEHF-4 met '
         'all of its requirements. A4 OOT was the first ever test to have all '
         'six AEHF operational terminals communicating over XDR. The terminal '
         'types include AEHF SMART-T, FAB-T, MMPU, NMT, Global ASNT and '
         'ACF-IC2. "This is a major milestone to celebrate with our customers '
         'at Space and Missiles Systems Center (SMC) the U.S. Air Force and '
         'our teammates Northrop Grumman, L3 Communications and Aerojet. As we '
         'turn our focus on launching AEHF-5 in June, one month early, I want '
         'to congratulate everyone involved in completing this one of a kind, '
         'high-performance network in space. This is a tremendous '
         'accomplishment for the AEHF program and I am proud of the team for '
         'consistently exceeding the customer\'s mission needs," said Mike '
         'Cacheiro , vice president of Protected Communications for Military '
         'Space. The addition of AEHF-4 to the constellation provides a new '
         'capability of global extended data rate (XDR) communications. XDR '
         'communications provides data rates to its users five times higher '
         'than medium data rate (MDR) and 350 times higher than low data rate '
         '(LDR) communications. Milstar, the predessor to AEHF, uses both LDR '
         'and MDR communication modes to directly support the warfighter. This '
         'was the last step before control authority of the satellite is '
         'handed over to the U.S. Air Force SMC where it will join the '
         'combined AEHF-Milstar constellation. The AEHF constellation provides '
         'global, survivable, highly secure and protected communications for '
         'strategic command and tactical warfighters operating on ground, sea '
         'and air platforms. The jam-resistant system also serves '

         'pension cost and the service cost component of FAS pension expense '

         'net FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the '
         'service cost component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. '
         'The non-service FAS pension cost component is included in other '
         "non‑operating expense, net on the corporation's consolidated "
         'statements of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases '
         'or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense '
         '(both service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating '
         'profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume '
         'refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit '
         'resulting from varying production activity or service levels on '
         'individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are '
         'typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular '
         "contract. In addition, comparability of the corporation's segment "
         'sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted '
         'favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the '
         "corporation's contracts for which it recognizes revenue over time "
         'using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure '
         'progress towards completion. Increases in profit booking rates, '
         'typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to '
         'revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance '
         'obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular '
         'contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may '
         'deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs '
         'to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit '
         'booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are '
         'recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date '
         'effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also '
         'be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or '
         'may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive '
         'resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and '
         'restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of '
         'assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of '
         'contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant '
         'severance actions which are excluded from segment operating results; '
         'reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on '
         "sales of certain assets. The corporation's consolidated net "
         'adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate '
         'adjustments, represented approximately 33 percent of total segment '

         '(NYSE: LMT) hosted a ceremony to celebrate its new F-16 production '

         'newly-refurbished hangar in Greenville , where the company will '
         'begin manufacturing F-16 Block 70 aircraft later this year. "This is '

         'Martin Aeronautics. "The future is bright, and it begins right here '
         'in Greenville, South Carolina ‒ the new home of F-16 production." '
         'Demand continues to soar for new production F-16s and F-16V '
         'upgrades. Bahrain became the first F-16 Block 70 customer in June '
         '2018 , Slovakia signed Letter of Agreement in Dec. 2018 for 14 Block '

         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) has transitioned additional F-35 suppliers to '
         'longer term Performance Based Logistics contracts and Master Repair '
         'Agreements to enhance supply availability and reduce sustainment '
         'costs. "As the F-35 fleet expands, we are partnering with our '
         'customers and taking aggressive actions to enhance F-35 readiness '
         'and reduce sustainment costs," said Greg Ulmer , Lockheed Martin '
         'vice president and general manager of the F-35 program. "The F-35 '
         "global supply chain is a key enabler to success, and we're "
         'restructuring and streamlining several contracts with key industry '
         'partners to provide the long-term stability that will allow them to '
         'make investments, improve efficiencies and optimize their '
         "performance. This is one of several actions we're taking across the "
         'supply chain to improve capacity, reduce costs and enhance supply '
         'availability." Previously under annual contracts, the new multi-year '
         'PBLs allow each company to make longer term investments and actions '
         'to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. In addition to PBL '
         'contracts, Lockheed Martin has established 12 Master Repair '
         'Agreements (MRAs) with key suppliers to enhance repair capacity and '
         'speed. The PBLs cover several contracts with BAE Systems, Northrop '
         'Grumman and Collins Elbit Vision Systems (CEVS); and the MRAs cover '
         'contracts with 12 separate suppliers including Honeywell, GE and '
         'Eaton. The initial multi-year contracts are already delivering '
         'benefits. A 2017 PBL contract awarded to BAE Systems for the '
         'Electronic Warfare subsystem is helping deliver a 25 percent '
         "improvement in the system's availability throughout global "
         'operations. Enhancing Readiness, Reducing Costs As the F-35 fleet '
         'expands, the F-35 Joint Program Office-led Hybrid Product Support '
         'Integration (HPSI) team is implementing the Global Support Solution '
         "(GSS) to enhance readiness and reduce costs. The F-35's reliability "
         'and readiness continues to improve and newer production aircraft are '
         'averaging greater than 60 percent mission capable rates with some '
         'operational squadrons consistently near 70 percent. Additionally, '
         'Lockheed Martin has reduced its portion of operating costs per '
         "aircraft by 15 percent since 2015. The F-35 enterprise's goal is to "
         'deliver 80 percent mission capable rates in the near term, and '
         'achieve a $25,000 Cost per Flight Hour (CPFH) by 2025, which is '
         'comparable to the cost to sustain legacy aircraft, while providing a '
         'generational leap in capability. As more aircraft enter service, the '
         'enterprise is optimizing resources across the fleet and leveraging '
         'data across hundreds of thousands of flight hours to achieve these '
         'goals. The program is conducting supply chain competitions, building '
         'supply chain capacity, synchronizing spare buys, improving parts '
         'reliability and maintainability, implementing advanced analytics '
         'tools, enhancing the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), '
         'accelerating modifications of earlier aircraft, and supporting the '
         'stand-up of government-led regional warehouses and repair depots. '
         'With stealth technology, advanced sensors, supersonic speed, weapons '
         'capacity and superior range, the F-35 is the most lethal, survivable '
         'and connected aircraft in the world. More than a fighter jet, the '
         "F-35's ability to collect, analyze and share data, is a powerful "
         'force multiplier that enhances all airborne, surface and '
         'ground-based assets in the battlespace enabling men and women in '

 'text': 'MILWAUKEE, Wis., April 11, 2019 – Lt. Col. Christine Mau, U.S. Air '
         'Force retired, who was the first-ever female F-35 pilot, speaks to '
         'Derco employees, invited guests and media concerning the world’s '
         'most capable multi-role fighter, the F-35 Lightning II. Mau, now a '
         'Lockheed Martin F-35 instructor pilot, shares her experiences and '
         'guides new “pilots” as they fly the F-35 Lightning II interactive '
         'cockpit demonstrator on display as part of Derco’s 40th anniversary '
         'events. The simulator highlights the fighter’s advanced technologies '
         'and combat capabilities. “The F-35 simulator is a great '
         'representation of how the actual jet flies and feels,” Mau said. '
         '“I’m very proud to continue supporting the U.S. military and our '
         'allies training F-35 pilots.” Derco joined the Lockheed Martin team '
         'in 2015 and maintains one of the largest, most diversified aircraft '
         'spares inventories in the world. It was named one of the Top '
         'Workplaces in Milwaukee for four consecutive years by Milwaukee '
         'Journal Sentinel. “We are extremely excited for our employees to '

         'provides such opportunities,” said Brian Holt, president of Derco, A '
         'Lockheed Martin Company. “This is a perfect way to thank our '
         'employees as well as celebrate Derco’s 40 years of supporting US and '
         'international militaries.” The F-35 program supports a broad '
         'industrial base of more than 1,400 suppliers in 45 states and Puerto '
         'Rico, contributing to more than 220,000 direct and indirect U.S. '
         'jobs and over $44.2 billion in annual economic impact. In Wisconsin, '
         'eight suppliers support the program amounting to $1.2 million in '
         'economic impact. The F-35 will replace a wide range of aging fighter '
         'and strike aircraft. Three variants derived from a common design '
         'will ensure the F-35 provides air superiority well into the future '

         "Martin's (NYSE: LMT)\xa0Pilotage Distributed Aperture Sensor (PDAS) "
         'system took flight for the first time aboard the V-280 Valor, Bell '
         "Helicopter's next-generation tiltrotor aircraft in a series of "
         'flights over Fort Worth, Texas , in March. PDAS is a '
         'multi-functional sensor system that generates high-resolution, '
         '360-degree imagery around the aircraft to enhance situational '
         'awareness for pilots and other users.  The PDAS system\xa0captured '
         'complete spherical infrared imagery while operating in a high-speed, '
         'tactically relevant flight environment and generated real-time '
         'imagery. "Conducting PDAS flight tests on the V-280 is an exciting '
         'first step toward delivering a level of situational awareness '
         'unavailable on today\'s Army rotorcraft," said Rita Flaherty , '
         'strategy & business development vice president at Lockheed Martin '
         'Missiles and Fire Control. "With its embedded, multi-functional '
         'sensors, PDAS is the ideal foundation for an integrated '
         'survivability suite that will enable Army aircrews to own any '
         'environment and universally detect and defeat incoming threats." '
         'Specifically designed for current and future vertical lift aircraft, '
         'PDAS consists of six infrared sensors distributed around the '
         'aircraft linked to aircrew helmets and cockpit displays via an '
         'open-architecture processor. During testing, engineers demonstrated '
         "PDAS's ability to provide simultaneous coverage to multiple "
         'independent displays. Aircrews benefit from its all-weather pilotage '
         'imagery while transported ground troops can survey the environment '
         'for tactical information and threats. While PDAS is currently '
         'generating imagery for two users, the system will ultimately support '
         'up to six users, which could include pilots in other aircraft and '
         'mission commanders on the ground. Planned capability upgrades will '
         'demonstrate additional integrated survivability suite capabilities '
         'like Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion (MMSF). MMSF blends data from '
         'multiple types of sensors to restore aircrew situational awareness '
         'in degraded visual environments and enables navigation in GPS-denied '

         'LMT) received a $1.13 billion contract from the U.S. Army for Lot 14 '
         'production of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets '
         'and associated equipment. The contract calls for the production of '
         'more than 9,500 GMLRS Unitary and Alternative-Warhead (AW) rockets, '
         'more than 300 Low-Cost Reduced-Range Practice Rockets (RRPRs) and '
         'integrated logistics support for the U.S. Army and international '
         'customers. Work will be performed at the Lockheed Martin facilities '
         'in Camden, Ark. ; Dallas and Lufkin, Texas ; and Ocala, Fla. , and '
         'will be completed by July 2021 . "The demand for GMLRS rounds, both '
         'domestically and internationally, continues to remain strong based '
         'on the excellent performance of the munition," said Gaylia Campbell '
         ', vice president of Precision Fires and Combat Maneuver Systems at '
         'Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. "Our primary focus with '
         'GMLRS is to continue producing these combat-proven munitions at a '
         'rate that meets the demands of our customers." GMLRS is an '
         'all-weather rocket designed for fast deployment that delivers '
         'precision strike beyond the reach of most conventional weapons. The '
         'GMLRS AW was the first munition developed to service area targets '
         'without the effects of unexploded ordinance. GMLRS unitary rockets '
         'exceed the required combat reliability rate and are cost-effective. '
         'The RRPR allows users to train with realistic, full-motored rockets '
         'with limited flight range, making them ideal for smaller testing '
         'ranges. In combat operations, each GMLRS rocket is packaged in an '
         'MLRS launch pod and is fired from the Lockheed Martin-produced '
         'HIMARS or M270 family of launchers. GMLRS was established as an '
         'international cooperative program. For more than 40 years, Lockheed '
         'Martin has been the leading designer and manufacturer of long-range, '
         'surface-to-surface precision strike solutions, providing highly '

 'text': 'CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida, March 26, 2019 – The U.S. Air Force’s '
         'second new GPS III satellite, bringing higher-power, more accurate '
         'and harder-to-jam signals to the GPS constellation, has arrived in '
         'Florida for launch. On March 18, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) shipped '
         'the Air Force’s second GPS III space vehicle (GPS III SV02) to Cape '
         'Canaveral for an expected July launch. Designed and built at '
         'Lockheed Martin’s GPS III Processing Facility near Denver, the '
         'satellite traveled from Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado, to the '
         'Cape on a massive Air Force C-17 aircraft. The Air Force nicknamed '
         'the GPS III SV02 “Magellan” after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand '
         'Magellan. GPS III is the most powerful and resilient GPS satellite '
         'ever put on orbit. Developed with an entirely new design, for U.S. '
         'and allied forces, it will have three times greater accuracy and up '
         'to eight times improved anti-jamming capabilities over the previous '
         'GPS II satellite design block, which makes up today’s GPS '
         'constellation. GPS III also will be the first GPS satellite to '
         'broadcast the new L1C civil signal. Shared by other international '
         'global navigation satellite systems, like Galileo, the L1C signal '
         'will improve future connectivity worldwide for commercial and '
         'civilian users. The Air Force began modernizing the GPS '
         'constellation with new technology and capabilities with the December '
         '23, 2018 launch of its first GPS III satellite. GPS III SV01 is now '
         'receiving and responding to commands from Lockheed Martin’s Launch '
         'and Checkout Center at the company’s Denver facility. “After orbit '
         'raising and antenna deployments, we switched on GPS III SV01’s '
         'powerful signal-generating navigation payload and on Jan. 8 began '
         'broadcasting signals,” Johnathon Caldwell, Lockheed Martin’s Vice '
         'President for Navigation Systems.\xa0“Our on orbit testing '
         'continues, but the navigation payload’s capabilities have exceeded '
         'expectations and the satellite is operating completely healthy.” GPS '
         'III SV02 is the second of ten new GPS III satellites under contract '
         'and in full production at Lockheed Martin. GPS III SV03-08 are now '
         'in various stages of assembly and test. The Air Force declared the '
         'second GPS III “Available for Launch” in August and, in November, '
         'called GPS III SV02 up for its 2019 launch. In September 2018, the '
         'Air Force selected Lockheed Martin for the GPS III Follow On (GPS '
         'IIIF) program, an estimated $7.2 billion opportunity to build up to '
         '22 additional GPS IIIF satellites with additional capabilities. GPS '
         'IIIF builds off Lockheed Martin’s existing modular GPS III, which '
         'was designed to evolve with new technology and changing mission '
         'needs. On September 26, the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin a $1.4 '
         'billion contract for support to start up the program and to contract '
         'the 11 th and 12 th GPS III satellite. Once declared operational, '
         'GPS III SV01 and SV02 are expected to take their place in today’s 31 '
         'satellite strong GPS constellation, which provides positioning, '
         'navigation and timing services to more than four billion civil, '

         '(NYSE: LMT) has developed a new LTE-over-Satellite system designed '
         'to provide connectivity to remote regions, including areas without '
         'cellphone coverage, boats off-shore, or during natural disasters '
         'like hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, catastrophic floods or '
         'volcanoes. New hotspots connect existing phones to satellites for '
         'reliable 4G connections. "When disaster strikes, cell phone networks '
         'often go down – whether because of the event or because of the sheer '
         'volume of traffic," said Maria Demaree , vice president and general '
         'manager of Mission Solutions at Lockheed Martin Space. "So, it\'s '
         'important to have new ways to connect families and first responders '
         'with people who would be otherwise cut off from contact." Typically, '
         'during an emergency that knocks out cellular networks, specialized '
         'satellite phones are the only option for mobile connectivity. While '
         'satellite phones will still play a key role in disaster recovery, '
         "Lockheed Martin's LTE-over-Satellite solution lets people complement "
         'satellite phones with their existing commercial phones to connect to '
         'a pop-up cellular network that is connected directly to a satellite. '
         'The system takes advantage of the fact that 4G devices are now '
         'widespread across the world. According to a 2018 Global mobile '
         'Suppliers Association (GSA) report, LTE now accounts for more than a '
         'third of all mobile subscriptions globally (35.7%). LTE offers '
         'broadband data rates in addition to voice and SMS, so important '
         'photos, files and commerce can still take place even if traditional '
         'communications infrastructure is disrupted. The new mobility system '
         "isn't limited to use during natural disaster or terrorist attacks, "
         'it can be potentially used by offshore fisherman located far from '
         'cell towers, remote mineral production outposts, scientific and '
         'research stations, and in agriculture operations. Hotspots can be '
         'mounted to vehicles, trucks, or ships to provide additional '
         'connectivity. For example, with a vehicular-mounted device, '
         'LTE-over-satellite connectivity follows a first responder straight '
         'to the scene without a separate device. It can be used on cargo '
         'trucks to transmit locational data, shipment information and allow '
         'vital voice communication to connect with a central dispatcher. '

 'text': 'CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. , March 14, 2019 / PRNewswire / --\xa0For '
         'long-duration, deep space missions, astronauts will need a highly '
         'efficient and reconfigurable space, and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'is researching and designing ways to support those missions. Under a '
         "public-private partnership as a part of NASA's Next Space "
         'Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) Phase II study '
         'contract, Lockheed Martin has completed the initial ground prototype '
         "for a cislunar habitat that would be compatible with NASA's Gateway "
         'architecture . This habitat will help NASA study and assess the '
         'critical capabilities needed to build a sustainable presence around '
         'the Moon and support pioneering human exploration in deep space. The '
         'full-scale prototype, or Habitat Ground Test Article (HGTA), is '
         'built inside of a repurposed shuttle-era cargo container, called a '
         'Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), at Kennedy Space Center . '
         'Using rapid prototyping and modern design tools like virtual and '
         'augmented reality, the team customized the interior making full use '
         'of the entire volume of the module to accommodate a variety of tasks '
         'like science missions and personal needs of future astronauts. The '
         'team also studied how to apply the advanced, deep space capabilities '
         "that are already built in to NASA's Orion spacecraft . Through "
         'additional research and development funding, the NextSTEP team also '
         'applied mixed-reality technology to further refine the concept. '
         '"Throughout the design and engineering process of this high-fidelity '
         'prototype, we have kept the diversity of missions top-of-mind," said '
         'Bill Pratt , Lockheed Martin Space NextSTEP program manager.\xa0 "By '
         'building modularity in from the beginning, our design can support '
         'Lunar orbit and surface science missions along with commercial '
         'operations, all while accelerating the path to the Moon." Over the '
         'past five months, the team used tools like virtual and augmented '
         'reality to simplify and streamline the build-up process. They also '
         "applied expertise from Lockheed Martin's heritage of operating "
         'autonomous interplanetary robotic missions, like OSIRIS-REx and '
         'InSight, to integrate reliable robotic capabilities in to the '
         'design. "Getting back to the Moon, and eventually Mars, is no small '
         'feat, but our team are mission visionaries," said Pratt. "They have '
         'worked to apply lessons learned from our experience with deep space '
         'robotic missions to this first-of-its-kind spacecraft around the '
         'Moon." The Lockheed Martin team will soon transition the prototype '
         'to the NASA NextSTEP team for assessment. During the week of March '
         '25 , a team of NASA astronauts will live and work inside the '
         'prototype, evaluating the layout and providing feedback.\xa0 The '
         'NASA test team will also validate the overall design and will be '
         'able to evaluate the standards and common interfaces, like the '
         'International Docking System Standard (IDSS), and how to apply those '
         'systems for long-term missions based at the Lunar Gateway. Once NASA '
         'testing has completed, Lockheed Martin will continue to optimize and '
         'study the prototype to prepare for other Lunar efforts. For '

 'text': 'DENVER , March 20, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin (NYSE: '
         'LMT) announced a new generation of space technology launching this '
         'year that will allow satellites to change their missions in orbit. '
         'Satellites that launched one, ten or even fifteen years ago largely '
         "have the same capability they had when they lifted off. That's "
         'changing with new architecture that will let users add capability '
         'and assign new missions with a software push, just like adding an '
         'app on a smartphone. This new tech, called SmartSat ™ , is a '
         'software-defined satellite architecture that will boost capability '
         'for payloads on several pioneering nanosats ready for launch this '
         'year. "Imagine a new type of satellite that acts more like a '
         'smartphone. Add a SmartSat app to your satellite in-orbit, and '
         'you\'ve changed the mission," said Rick Ambrose , executive vice '
         'president of Lockheed Martin Space. "We are the first to deploy this '
         'groundbreaking technology on multiple missions. SmartSat will give '
         'our customers unparalleled resiliency and flexibility for changing '
         'mission needs and technology, and it unlocks even greater processing '
         'power in space." This year Lockheed Martin is integrating SmartSat '
         'technology on ten programs and counting, including the Linus and '
         'Pony Express nanosats, which will be the first to launch. These are '
         'rapid-prototype, testbed satellites using internal research and '
         'development funding, ready for 2019 launches on the first LM 50 '
         'nanosatellite buses: "SmartSat is a major step forward in our '
         'journey to completely transform the way we design, build and deliver '
         'satellites," said Ambrose. "The LM 50 bus is the perfect platform '
         "for testing this new, groundbreaking technology. We're self-funding "
         'these missions to demonstrate a number of new capabilities that can '
         'plug into any satellite in our fleet, from the LM 50 nanosat to our '
         'flagship LM 2100. And the same technology not only plugs into ground '
         'stations, improving space-ground integration, it will one day '
         'connect directly with planes, ships and ground vehicles, connecting '
         'front-line users to the power of space like never before." Cyber '
         'security is at the core of this new technology. SmartSat-enabled '
         'satellites can reset themselves faster, diagnose issues with greater '
         'precision and back each other up when needed, significantly '
         'enhancing resiliency. Satellites can also better detect and defend '
         'against cyber threats autonomously, and on-board cyber defenses can '
         'be updated regularly to address new threats. SmartSat uses a '
         "hypervisor to securely containerize virtual machines. It's a "
         'technology that lets a single computer operate multiple servers '
         'virtually to maximize memory, on-board processing and network '
         'bandwidth. It takes advantage of multi-core processing, something '
         'new to space. That lets satellites process more data in orbit so '
         'they can beam down just the most critical and relevant '
         'information—saving bandwidth costs and reducing the burden on ground '
         "station analysts, and ultimately opening the door for tomorrow's "
         'data centers in space. SmartSat uses a high-power, '
         'radiation-hardened computer developed by the National Science '
         "Foundation's Center for Space, High-performance, and Resilient "
         'Computing, or SHREC. Lockheed Martin helps fund SHREC research, and '
         'in turn gains access to world-class technologies and student '
         'researchers. About Lockheed Martin Headquartered in Bethesda, '

         'Association International Heli-Expo show. The S-92 helicopter boasts '
         'a best-in-class safety record and sets the industry standard for '
         'reliability. These changes to the venerable S-92 helicopter will '
         'introduce new technology that is focused on reliability and '
         'operating cost reduction, while at the same time delivering '
         'increased capability. Changes will increase commonality of the '
         'aircraft between the offshore, SAR, and utility configurations and '
         'allow for speedier reconfiguration between roles, making it an even '
         'better choice for operators that want a diverse aircraft capable of '
         'multiple missions. Sikorsky expects to launch an hourly aftermarket '
         'support program, reflecting a targeted economic improvement of the '
         'S-92A+ and S-92B, that will be available concurrent with deliveries. '
         "Sikorsky's S-92 helicopter fleet update will include the "
         'introduction of phase one MATRIX TM technology that will bring '
         'advanced computing power to the platform. This foundation enables '
         'adoption of autonomous landing technology such as Rig Approach TM '
         "2.0 and a new technology from Sikorsky's Innovations lab called "
         'SuperSearch TM that uses advanced algorithms to locate objects up to '
         '30 percent faster. Both aircraft will include SAR AFCS and a newly '
         'designed interior that is lighter and common to both SAR and OSO '
         'missions. Notably, both configurations will include the Phase IV '
         'main gearbox. This gearbox has been validated to exceed the '
         'requirements of CFR 29.927(c) as demonstrated by full-scale testing '
         'witnessed by the FAA. All of the primary lubrication system oil was '
         'removed prior to operating the gearbox for the equivalent of over '
         '500 nautical miles of flight at an airspeed of 80 knots. No '
         'discernable anomalies were identified during the post-test '
         "examination. General Electric's CT7-8A6 engine, capable of producing "
         'more power in higher altitudes and hotter temperatures, also will be '
         'available as an option for both the S-92A+ and S-92B products. '
         'Sikorsky has significantly invested to bring these capabilities into '
         'production, but will let market interest determine the pace of '
         'remaining internal research and development spending. Current plans '
         'have initial availability set for 2022 and have an S-92B helicopter '
         'price target below historical S-92 prices. The S-92A+ kit is being '
         'designed to allow common fleet benefit at an economical targeted '
         'price. "Our S-92 aircraft has set the standard for modern '
         "helicopters, and we're excited with these changes that will ensure "
         'it remains so," said Audrey Brady , Sikorsky Vice President, '
         'Commercial Systems & Services. "Reliability means safety. '
         'Reliability means economics. With these updates and an unmatched '
         'cabin size and capacity, our customers will see an economic benefit '
         'demonstrating that the S-92 is the best choice in helicopter '
         'missions near or far." "We think safety is a good investment, and so '
         "we welcome Sikorsky's investment in this significant new technology, "
         'which will drive greater reliability, resilience and operational '
         'capability," said Gretchen Haskins , CEO of HeliOffshore. Since '
         '2004, Sikorsky has delivered more than 300 production S-92 '
         'helicopters. The industry standard for safety and reliability, the '
         'S-92 helicopter is the preferred aircraft of its size class for '
         'offshore oil worker transportation. In 2018, the fleet flew 175,000 '
         'hours, a record for the fleet, contributing to a total of nearly 1.5 '
         'million hours flown. For more information visit Sikorsky Commercial '

 'text': 'ATLANTA , March 5, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- Sikorsky, a Lockheed '
         'Martin company (NYSE: LMT), today recognized the heroic efforts of a '
         'CHC Helicopter crew with a Sikorsky Rescue Award, highlighting a '
         'successful search and rescue mission conducted with an S-92® '
         'helicopter. Sikorsky President Dan Schultz presented the Winged-S '
         'Rescue Award in a ceremony at the 2019 Helicopter Association '
         'International Heli-Expo. The CHC crew, based in Statfjord, Norway , '
         'saved two sailors in the midst of a storm in late November by '
         'navigating an S-92 aircraft through winds of up to 80 miles per '
         'hour. The sailors had sent out a mayday call after their boat got '
         'caught in waves more than 30 feet high. "Since the sailing boat was '
         'adrift and laying perpendicular to the waves, it was impossible to '
         'pick up the survivors straight from their sailing boat," said '
         "Patrick Gerritsen , CHC Norway's SAR chief pilot and senior officer. "
         '"The mast of the sailing boat was sweeping dangerously, while the '
         'boat was being rocked sideways by the waves." The crew instructed '
         'the sailors to jump overboard to be winched to safety while keeping '
         'contact with the vessel. Within 20 minutes of their arrival, both '
         'survivors had been pulled aboard the S-92 helicopter and were '
         'receiving treatment. The boat sunk shortly after the rescue, but due '
         'to the quick work of the CHC crew and the search and rescue '
         'capabilities of the S-92 aircraft, both individuals were unharmed. '
         '"We are honored to recognize CHC today for this achievement and for '
         "fulfilling our founder Igor Sikorsky's vision of the helicopter as a "
         'life-saving machine," said Sikorsky President Dan Schultz . "This '
         'team demonstrated a commitment to saving lives, no matter the danger '
         'to themselves. We are proud to recognize aircrews who continue to '
         "reflect Sikorsky's mission to bring people home safely everywhere, "
         'every time." "On behalf of all of us at CHC, I want to thank '
         'Sikorsky for helping us honor the crew responsible for this rescue," '
         'said Karl Fessenden , president and CEO of CHC. "These brave men '
         'gladly risk their lives to save others and count on having a '
         "reliable rotorcraft behind them every time they enter harm's way. "
         'The S-92 remains a key staple of our global search and rescue fleet '
         'and plays a major role in taking care of our crews and passengers '
         'throughout the world." CHC currently operates eight S-92s configured '
         'for SAR operations worldwide. Beginning in 1950, the Winged-S Rescue '
         'Award Program honors those who perform rescues flying a Sikorsky '
         'helicopter. Through this award, Sikorsky acknowledges the '
         'humanitarian efforts of pilots and crewmembers who put themselves in '
         "harm's way to save others, fulfilling Igor Sikorsky's vision of the "
         'helicopter. As of 2018, the Sikorsky S-92 has flown nearly 1.5 '
         'million total flight hours, predominantly for operators serving the '
         'worldwide offshore oil and gas industry and for civil search and '
         'rescue operations. Twelve nations have selected the S-92 helicopter '
         'for their head of state missions. In May 2014 , Sikorsky was '
         'selected to build the next U.S. Presidential Helicopter Fleet, the '
         "world's most advanced executive transport helicopter, using the S-92 "

         'delivered the first of four HC-130J Combat King II aircraft today to '
         'representatives from the New York Air National Guard’s 106th Rescue '
         'Wing (RQW). This HC-130J will be operated by the 102nd Rescue '
         'Squadron (RQS) at Francis S. Grabreski Air National Guard Base, New '
         'York. The 102nd RQS, which is part of the 106th Rescue Wing (RQW), '
         'currently operates a legacy fleet of HC-130P/N variant Combat King I '
         'aircraft, which will be replaced by four new HC-130Js. The squadron '
         'will use its HC-130Js to refuel the New York Air National Guard’s '
         '101st RQS HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, which were manufactured by '
         'Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky business in Stratford, Connecticut. Like '
         'others in the U.S. Air Force Rescue community, the 106th RQW lives '
         'by the motto, "That Others May Live," which reflects its mission of '
         'supporting combat search and rescue anywhere in the world. Crews '
         'from the 106th RQW rely on HC-130s to extend the range of combat '
         'search and rescue helicopters by providing air refueling in hostile '
         'or contested airspace. Other mission capabilities include performing '
         'tactical delivery of pararescue teams, small bundles, zodiac '
         'watercraft or four-wheel drive all-terrain vehicles; and providing '
         'direct assistance to survivors in advance of a recovery vehicle. '
         '"The HC-130 Hercules aircraft has been an essential part of the '
         '106th’s Rescue Wing’s fleet for many decades, supporting these brave '
         'Airmen in meeting their mission requirements time and time again,” '

         'performance to support their crews in doing what they do best: '
         'saving lives and protecting the people they serve.” The HC-130J is '
         'the only dedicated fixed-wing personnel recovery platform in the Air '
         'Force and Air National Guard. The HC-130J supports missions in '
         'adverse weather and geographic environments, including reaching '
         'austere locations. The HC-130J is also tasked for airdrop, airland, '
         'and helicopter air-to-air refueling and forward-area ground '
         'refueling missions. It also supports humanitarian aid operations, '
         'disaster response, security cooperation/aviation advisory, emergency '
         'aeromedical evacuation and noncombatant evacuation operations.  The '
         'HC-130J is one of eight production variants of the C-130J Super '
         'Hercules, the current production model of the legendary C-130 '
         'Hercules aircraft. With 400+ aircraft delivered, the C-130J is the '
         'airlifter of choice for 20 nations. The global Super Hercules fleet '

 'text': 'Stratford, C onn, March 20, 2019 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin '
         'company (NYSE: LMT) has recognized the County of Los Angeles Fire '
         'Department’s Air Operations Section for its efforts in combating '
         'last November’s devastating Woolsey Fire with firefighting '
         'helicopters. The Fire Department operates eight multi-mission '
         'helicopters, including three S-70A Sikorsky Firehawk aircraft. '
         'During a March 12 ceremony at the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors, '
         'Sikorsky North America Regional Executive Jeanette Eaton presented '
         'Fire Chief Darryl Osby with the Sikorsky Humanitarian Award. “Our '
         'company’s founder Igor Sikorsky designed a vertical lift machine for '
         'the purpose of saving lives. He would applaud the courage and '
         'persistence that the County of Los Angeles Fire Department '
         'demonstrated to fight the Woolsey Fire,” said Eaton. “Risking your '
         'lives to save others, and dedicating your time to keep these '
         'aircraft flying, embody the highest ideal of humanitarian service. '
         'This award was inspired by your actions during the Woolsey Fire.” '
         'The most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles County history started '
         'Nov. 8, 2018. Pushed by 50-mile-an-hour Santa Ana winds, the fire '
         'quickly grew to a 14-mile fire line that burned 97,000 acres and '
         'destroyed over 1,600 structures in the communities of Agoura Hills, '
         'Calabasas, Bell Canyon, Malibu, Malibu Lake, and Oak Park. More than '
         '250,000 people were evacuated during the 13-day ordeal. Los Angeles '
         'County’s three Sikorsky Firehawk helicopters aggressively attacked '
         'the fire, dropping water from each aircraft’s 1,000-gallon external '
         'water tank for 40 of the first 48 hours of the fight, when high '
         'winds prevented other helicopters from flying. The three Firehawk '
         'aircraft accumulated a total of 120 flight hours and 350 water drops '
         'during the first seven days. The Humanitarian Award is the Los '
         'Angeles County Fire Department’s second recognition by Sikorsky this '
         'year for the Woolsey operation. On Feb. 11, Sikorsky’s President Dan '
         'Schultz presented the Sikorsky Rescue Award to 35 pilots and '
         'crewmembers, and the Sikorsky Superior Maintenance Award to 21 '
         'members of the Maintenance Unit of the Air Operations Section. “The '
         'Los Angeles County Fire Department is humbled to be recognized by '
         'Sikorsky for our work protecting lives, property and the '
         'environment. We could not execute our mission without our Sikorsky '
         'helicopters,” said Osby. “These instrumental and critical resources '
         'allow us to successfully serve the millions of residents in Los '
         'Angeles County each day. We can depend on our helicopter fleet to '
         'help us aggressively fight wildfires by dropping thousands of '
         'gallons of water; performing dangerous hoist and swift water '
         'rescues; and quickly transporting patients, fire crews, and '

         'Today Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), Diehl Defence and Saab announced '
         'the Falcon™ air defense weapon system as the short and medium-range '
         'air defense solution for current and emerging threats. Falcon '
         "integrates Diehl's 40-kilometer range Infra-Red Imaging System "
         'Tail/Thrust Vector-Controlled (IRIS-T) SLM interceptor and vertical '
         "launcher, Saab's 360-degree AESA Giraffe 4A radar through Lockheed "
         "Martin's flexible SkyKeeper command and control battle manager. "
         "Falcon's open architecture allows the system to easily integrate "
         'into any air operations center. Threats such as unmanned aerial '
         'systems carrying lethal payloads, cruise missiles that can attack '
         'from any direction, and fixed and rotary winged aircraft capable of '
         'delivering ordnance at extended ranges, demand a technologically '
         'advanced solution that Falcon delivers. "Our international customers '
         'are looking for the next generation short and medium range air '
         'defense solution. Falcon is threat driven and ready now," said Scott '
         'Arnold , Lockheed Martin vice president and deputy for Integrated '
         'Air and Missile Defense. "Falcon is a great example of working with '
         'our customers to identify potential gaps and find rapid-response '
         'solutions to take on today\'s evolving threats." The Diehl IRIS-T '
         'SLM is a highly maneuverable interceptor fired from a 360-degree '
         'vertical launcher with the ability to engage multiple targets '
         'simultaneously in all weather conditions. The Saab Giraffe 4A AESA '
         'radar offers high discrimination capabilities and leverages gallium '
         'nitrate technology to detect and track both fixed and rotary-wing '
         'aircraft and drones, while simultaneously featuring an Automatic '
         "Sense & Warn functionality. Lockheed Martin's SkyKeeper command and "
         'control battle manager gives commanders unparalleled situational '
         'awareness with real-time early warning of incoming threats and '
         'optimized engagement solutions for critical decision making. '
         'Together these elements make the Falcon weapon system the only '

 'text': 'PALO ALTO, Calif. , Feb. 26, 2019 / PRNewswire / -- Cells form the '
         'cornerstone of life, and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) is researching '
         'ways to create the building blocks of novel materials. In a new '
         'cooperative agreement with the Army Research Laboratory, Lockheed '
         'Martin material scientists will work with industry and Army '
         'scientists who design microbes to edit single-cell organism DNA. '
         'They will investigate a range of capabilities, particularly those '
         'that can improve defense optical technology and coatings. "Cells '
         "efficiently create all sorts of materials, like a spider's silk or a "
         "butterfly's iridescent wings. We want to harness nature's process to "
         'better protect people," said Melissa Rhoads , senior research '
         'manager and Lockheed Martin lead for the project. "Biodesign exists '
         "today, but it doesn't exist at the scale and to the quality of "
         'defense standards." Biology and technology intersect in the field of '
         'biodesign. Some fashion houses even use the sustainable technology '
         "to develop fabrics for clothing, but Lockheed Martin's Advanced "
         'Technology Center sees potential to mature the science to a more '
         'precise level. This maturation requires collaboration between ARL '
         'and Lockheed Martin and leverages commercial advances from companies '
         'such as Ginkgo Bioworks. Scientists often look to nature to provide '
         'inspiration, and those ideas can help lower the cost of optical '
         'technologies. For example, telescopes use lenses to filter out '
         'unwanted light or to get a clearer image. However, a squid lens is '
         'able to filter and focus light in compact package due to '
         'molecule-based design and varied refractive index. In another '
         "example, melanin protects humans and animals alike from the Sun's UV "
         'rays. So melanin—or similar molecules with protective '
         "functions—could be another natural substance attracting the study's "
         'attention. "We can\'t manufacture that kind of capability, so '
         'Lockheed Martin will try nature\'s way," Rhoads said. "Harnessing '
         'the power of self-assembling materials is sustainable, affordable '
         'and can be much faster to produce than artificial methods. As much '
         'potential there is for biodesign, the maturity of the materials '
         'technology is still low, so our five-year study will advance this '
         'field significantly for precision science." The $10 million , '
         'five-year agreement uses the name Self-Assembly of Nanostructures '
         "for Tunable Materials and will leverage the Army's Open Campus model "
         'to enable collaboration between university, small-business, Army and '
         'Lockheed Martin scientists and engineers. Partnerships across '
         'industry and government groups have grown from programs like the '

         'their maiden flights, which will occur before mid-year at the '
         'Sikorsky West Palm Beach site in Florida . Both aircraft, which are '
         'being built for the U.S. Air Force, were transported late last year '
         "to West Palm Beach following final assembly at Sikorsky's facility "
         'in Stratford, Connecticut . The aircraft test readiness review was '
         'completed in October 2018 . The CRH HH-60W flight test team is '
         'currently preparing both aircraft for flight by conducting final '
         'installation of instrumentation and ground run testing. This marks '
         'formal entry into the flight test program that culminates in Ready '
         'Assets Available (RAA), allowing the Air Force to declare Initial '
         'Operational Capability (IOC). "Having these initial HH-60W '
         'helicopters in West Palm Beach for flight test is an exciting time '
         'for the Sikorsky team. It is the first step toward a low rate '
         'initial production decision later this year, which will allow '
         'Sikorsky to provide a constant production flow of aircraft to the '
         'warfighter," said Greg Hames , Sikorsky director, Combat Rescue '
         'Helicopter program. "This is the point in the program when Sikorsky '
         "begins providing new aircraft into the warfighters' hands, "
         'initiating transition to the vastly more capable and reliable HH-60W '
         'Combat Rescue Helicopter." The first of the two HH-60W aircraft will '
         'enter flight test with the new Tactical Mission Kit. The integration '
         'of sensors, radar, and multiple defense systems will bring added '
         "intelligence into the cockpit, enhancing pilots' situational "
         'awareness to complete missions, which is key to improving aircraft '
         "and isolated personnel survivability. Sikorsky's HH-60W team "
         'completed the System Configuration Test Readiness Review milestones '
         'for the Tactical Mission Kit last year. The HH-60W hosts a new fuel '
         'system that nearly doubles the capacity of the internal tank on a '
         'UH-60M Black Hawk, giving the Air Force crew extended range and more '
         'capability to rescue those injured in the battle space. The CRH '
         'specification drives more capable defensive system, vulnerability '
         'reduction, weapons, cyber-security, environmental, and net-centric '
         'requirements than currently held by the HH-60G. "Our team is working '
         'every day to build and deliver a superior quality helicopter to the '
         'U.S. Air Force for this critical mission," added Hames. "Both '
         'Sikorsky and the Air Force remain committed to achieving a low rate '
         'initial production decision this year and getting this much-needed '
         'aircraft to our air men and women out in the field." A total of nine '
         'aircraft will be built in Connecticut during the Engineering '

 'text': 'San Antonio , Texas, March 4, 2019 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         'officially opened the doors to its newest cyber facility located at '
         'Port San Antonio’s Project Tech complex with a ribbon-cutting '
         'ceremony and open house. Eight months ago Lockheed Martin announced '
         'its decision to lease the 15,000 square feet office. Since then, the '
         'has been transformed into secure workspace, including labs to '
         'develop new cyber tools and platforms. “Because of the continuously '
         'evolving cyber threat, we’ve seen an increase in demand for relevant '
         'services and technologies,” said Jon Rambeau, vice president and '
         'general manager of Lockheed Martin’s C6ISR division within Rotary '
         'and Mission Systems. “So much so that we recently expanded our cyber '
         'business to comprise not one, but now two market segments – Cyber '
         'Solutions and Spectrum Convergence – both of which will have teams '
         'doing work at the new facility.” Over the course of the next five '
         'years, Lockheed Martin will need to hire more than 100 cyber '
         'professionals in the San Antonio area to meet the growing demand, '
         'including software and systems engineers, cyber architects, '
         'intelligence analysts, and more. While the virtual nature of cyber '
         'work allows you to work anywhere, Lockheed Martin chose Project '

 'text': 'Atlanta , March 5, 2019 – Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: '
         'LMT) issued a beta version of its iFly Sikorsky™ performance '
         'calculator for the S-70i™ Black Hawk ® helicopter. Available from '
         'the Apple Store as an iPad tablet app, iFly Sikorsky gives S-70i '
         'administrators, pilots and mission planners a quick and easy method '
         'to configure aircraft cabin layout and installed mission equipment; '
         'calculate aircraft weight and balance; access weather data; review '
         'takeoff, landing, and cruise profiles; predict aircraft performance '
         'during each phase of flight; and determine range relative to '
         'aircraft position and intended destination. “What can take 15 '
         'minutes with the Rotorcraft Flight Manual can take seconds with the '
         'iFly Sikorsky app,” said Simon Gharibian, director, Global '
         'Sustainment Centers of Excellence, Lockheed Martin Rotary and '
         'Missions Systems. “Pilots can compile accurate information about '
         'optimum flight performance that greatly enhances aircraft safety. '
         'Following beta testing during early 2019, we will be offering this '
         'capability to militaries and government agencies around the world '
         'that are flying S-70i Black Hawk helicopters.” Launched in 2013 for '
         'operators of Sikorsky S-92A ® and S-76D™ commercial helicopters, the '
         'iFly Sikorsky app has steadily grown in content from a simple '
         'performance calculator to a highly efficient and connected preflight '
         'planning application. The first release of the app for the S-70i '
         'model Black Hawk helicopter contains many of the features from the '
         'latest 2.2.1 commercial release. With the iFly Sikorsky app, an '
         'S-70i pilot can ‘build’ the aircraft to be flown, and then navigate '
         'the toolbars to understand aircraft performance by phase of flight. '
         'A typical workflow with the app might play out as follows: '
         'Configuration — Build internal and external aircraft configurations '
         'from an established list of equipment by adding seats, mission '
         'equipment, cargo and fuel. Or use available tools to build highly '
         'customized profiles. Define aircraft basic empty weight and center '
         'of gravity. Determine external drag from open sliding doors and '
         'other external options such as searchlights, rescue hoists, sensors, '
         'external stores systems, and the Firehawk® belly water tank. Weight '
         'and Balance — Calculate the aircraft’s center of gravity, takeoff '
         'and landing weights using an intuitive user interface or the Weight '
         '& Balance calculator. Input crew, passengers, fuel, cargo, external '
         'stores, and external loads. Planning — Access METAR and TAF weather '
         'data for origin and destination airports and push environmental '
         'conditions (temperature, pressure altitude, winds, etc.) to the '
         'performance pages. In-Flight Performance — View graphically the '
         'following Aircraft Profiles: Hover, Takeoff, Cruise and Landing. '
         'Manually update environmental conditions and fuel to quickly '
         'reevaluate aircraft performance in flight. Verify fuel to '
         'destination based on aircraft position, aircraft range, and relative '
         'position to the intended destination. Summary — Summary provides an '
         'overview of the aircraft configuration, loading and configuration '
         'throughout the flight profile. The summary page can be texted, '
         'emailed or printed to document mission profiles as required. '
         'Sikorsky invites interested Black Hawk operators to test the iFly '
         'Sikorsky app by emailing their interest to '
         'sikorsky360.gr-sik@lmco.com , or visiting the Sikorsky booth during '

         '(NYSE: LMT) and the University of Central Florida (UCF) celebrated '
         "the grand opening of a new Cyber Innovation Lab on UCF's campus that "
         'will help meet the growing local and national need for cybersecurity '
         "talent. The lab's opening was celebrated with a ribbon cutting, a "
         "demonstration by UCF's Collegiate Cyber Defense Club (Hack@UCF) and "
         'a panel discussion with U.S. military and Lockheed Martin cyber '
         'experts about technology trends and how students can prepare for a '
         'career in the growing field. "This lab will serve as the campus\' '
         'primary hub for students to develop and expand their information '
         'security skills, preparing them to enter this high demand field and '
         'take on the cyber security threats of the future," said UCF '
         'President Dale Whittaker . "We are grateful for Lockheed Martin\'s '
         "longtime partnership and strong commitment to our students' "

         'help create the Cyber Innovation Lab and encourage the '
         'next-generation of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) '
         "talent to collaborate and solve today's challenging cyber problems. "
         "The company's donation will fund software and technology support to "
         'the lab, and employees will also provide cyber training and '
         'professional mentoring to engineering students. "Having a '
         'centralized space will streamline the way we organize our meetings '
         'and practices," said Hack@UCF President David Maria , a senior '
         'studying computer engineering. \xa0"With this lab, we can practice '
         'for competitions, host workshops and speakers, provide cyber '
         'security tools and resources, and give our student members a sense '
         "of community and help get them ready for future careers. It's not "
         'just a practice space. It\'s a home for us." The 970-square-foot lab '
         "is located in UCF's Engineering I building and will serve as a "
         'learning hub for the more than 350 students participating in cyber '
         'programs at UCF. Hack@UCF, a four-time national champion in '
         'competitions like the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and the '
         'U.S. Department of Energy CyberForce Competition, will also use the '
         'lab as its primary practice center. In Orlando , Lockheed Martin '

         'Aerostructures Limited (TLMAL) recently delivered the 100th C-130J '
         'Super Hercules empennage from its manufacturing facility located in '
         'Hyderabad, India. The delivery milestone highlights the ongoing '
         'success of Lockheed Martin’s hallmark Make in India partnership with '
         'Tata. TLMAL — a joint venture between Tata Advanced Systems Limited '
         '(TASL) and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics [NYSE: LMT] — was established '
         'in 2010 in Hyderabad. TLMAL exemplifies the Make in India goals and '
         'has the distinction of being the single global source of C-130J '
         'empennage assemblies that are installed on all new Super Hercules '
         'aircraft produced in Marietta, Georgia, in the United States. '
         'Empennage assemblies produced by TLMAL include the aircraft’s '
         'horizontal and vertical stabilizers along with leading edges and tip '
         'assemblies. The TLMAL team also previously manufactured sets of '
         'C-130J center wing box components, and introduced a new cutting-edge '
         '4,700 square-meter metal-to-metal bonding facility in May 2018. '
         'TLMAL currently employs 500 people. “It is a moment of great pride '
         'and honor for TLMAL, as it delivers the100th empennage. The joint '
         'venture has been a great example of successful U.S ̶ India '
         'Industrial partnership and a testimony to Lockheed Martin’s and '
         'Tata’s intent of developing aerospace manufacturing in India,” said '
         'Sukaran Singh, chief executive officer and managing director, TASL. '
         '“I congratulate the operations team that has ensured all deliveries '
         'ahead of schedule that will go a long way in extending our '
         'partnership to a new level with Lockheed Martin. TLMAL empennages '

         'search and rescue, peacekeeping, combat delivery, maritime patrol, '
         'special operations, aerial refueling, medevac and humanitarian '
         'response missions. TLMAL empennages are also included in the LM-100J '
         '─ the commercial variant of the Super Hercules. “The C-130J has a '
         'global presence both in its operations as well as within its core '
         'structure, as exemplified by its TLMAL-built empennage,” said Karmyn '
         'Norwood, vice president of International Programs for Air Mobility & '
         'Maritime Missions at Lockheed Martin. “I’ve been privileged to watch '
         'our TLMAL partnership grow significantly in terms of capability over '
         'the past few years. This growth is due, in large part, to the '
         'outstanding team that builds these empennages. This team’s pride and '
         'commitment to quality is built into each and every empennage!” The '
         'C-130J Super Hercules is the proven standard in tactical airlift, '
         'providing a unique mix of versatility and performance to complete '
         'any mission, anytime, anywhere. It is the current variant of the '

         'Systems business. 3 In the fourth quarter of 2018, the corporation '

         'million ($40\xa0million, or $0.14 per share, after tax, for the year '
         'ended Dec. 31, 2017), which represents its portion of a non-cash '
         'asset impairment charge recorded by AMMROC. 4 In the fourth quarter '
         'of 2017, the corporation recognized a previously deferred non-cash '
         'gain of $198 million ($122 million, or $0.43 per share, after tax, '
         'in the fourth quarter and $0.42 per share, after tax, for the year '
         'ended Dec. 31, 2017), related to properties sold in 2015 as a result '
         'of completing its remaining obligations. 5 In the fourth quarter of '
         '2017, the corporation recorded a net one-time charge of $2.0\xa0'
         'billion ($6.88 per share in the fourth quarter and $6.77\xa0per '
         'share in 2017), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily '

         'one-time charge, see the Income Taxes section and the Non-GAAP '
         'Measures of this news release. 6 In the fourth quarter of 2017, the '
         'corporation recognized an additional gain of $73\xa0million related '
         'to the Aug. 16, 2016 divestiture of its Information Systems & Global '
         'Solutions (IS&GS) business, which reflects certain post-closing '
         'adjustments, including\xa0 the final determination of net working '

         'potentially dilutive securities to have an anti-dilutive effect, '
         'resulting in the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and '

         "corporation's historical presentation, the net FAS/CAS pension "
         'adjustment is presented as a single amount and includes expected '
         '2019 U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) pension cost of '
         'approximately $2,565 million and expected financial accounting '
         'standards (FAS) pension expense of approximately $1,090 million. CAS '
         'pension cost and the service cost component of FAS pension expense '
         'is included in operating profit as part of cost of sales. The '
         'non-service cost component of FAS pension expense is included in '
         "non-operating expense on the corporation's consolidated statement of "
         "earnings. For additional detail on the corporation's FAS/CAS pension "
         'adjustment see the supplemental table included at the end of this '
         'news release. 2 The foregoing outlook for 2019 does not reflect '
         'potential benefits, if any, from additional tax deductions for '
         'foreign derived intangible income under proposed US Treasury '
         'regulations that are expected to be released in the near future. '
         'Such proposed tax regulations, if favorable, may have a beneficial '
         'impact on our 2019 earnings, effective tax rate, and earnings per '
         'share. The corporation expects the 2019 net FAS/CAS pension benefit '
         'to be approximately $1.5 billion based on a 4.25 percent discount '
         'rate (a 62.5\xa0basis point increase from the end of 2017), a '
         'negative 5.0 percent return on plan assets in 2018, a 7.0 percent '
         'expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years (a '
         '50\xa0basis point decrease from the end of 2017), and the revised '
         'longevity assumptions released during the fourth quarter of 2018 by '
         'the Society of Actuaries. As a result of the $5.0 billion in '
         'contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in '
         '2018, the corporation does not expect to make contributions to its '

         "Operating profit of the corporation's business segments includes our "
         'share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the '
         'operating activities of the investees are closely aligned with the '
         'operations of its business segments. Operating profit of the '
         "corporation's business segments also excludes the FAS/CAS operating "
         'adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not '
         'considered allowable or allocable to contracts with its largest '
         'customer, the U.S. Government, under the applicable U.S. government '
         'cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations '
         "(FAR), and other items not considered part of management's "
         'evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of '
         'management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, '
         'environmental costs, compensation expense, retiree benefits, '
         'significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains '
         'or losses from significant divestitures, and other miscellaneous '
         'corporate activities. The corporation recovers CAS pension cost '
         'through the pricing of its products and services on U.S. Government '
         'contracts and, therefore, recognizes CAS pension cost in each of its '
         "business segment's net sales and cost of sales. The corporation's "
         'consolidated financial statements must present FAS pension and other '
         'postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with '
         'U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (FAS) requirements '
         'under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension '
         'adjustment represents the difference between the service cost '
         'component of FAS pension expense and CAS pension cost. The '
         'non-service FAS pension cost component is included in other '
         "non-operating expense, net on the corporation's consolidated "
         'statements of earnings. The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment increases '
         'or decreases CAS pension cost to equal total FAS pension expense '
         '(both service and non-service). Changes in net sales and operating '
         'profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume '
         'refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit '
         'resulting from varying production activity or service levels on '
         'individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are '
         'typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular '
         "contract. In addition, comparability of the corporation's segment "
         'sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted '
         'favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the '
         "corporation's contracts for which it recognizes revenue over time "
         'using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure '
         'progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, '
         'typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to '
         'revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance '
         'obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular '
         'contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may '
         'deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs '
         'to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit '
         'booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are '
         'recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date '
         'effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also '
         'be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or '
         'may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive '
         'resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and '
         'restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of '
         'assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of '
         'contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant '
         'severance actions which are excluded from segment operating results; '
         'reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on '
         "sales of certain assets. The corporation's consolidated net profit "
         'adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate '
         'adjustments and other items, represented approximately 29 percent '
         'and 32 percent of total segment operating profit for the quarter and '
         'year ended Dec.\xa031,\xa02018, compared to approximately 33 percent '

         "Space's operating profit in 2018 increased $75 million , or 8 "
         'percent, compared to 2017. Operating profit increased approximately '
         '$40 million for commercial satellite programs, which reflect a lower '

         'including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were '
         'about $30 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017. Total equity '

         'approximately $205\xa0million, or 21 percent, during the quarter and '
         "the year ended Dec.\xa031,\xa02017. Income Taxes The corporation's "
         'effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 15.5 '
         'percent and 13.6 percent in the quarter and year ended Dec.\xa0'
         '31,\xa02018, compared to 152.0 percent and 64.0 percent in the '
         'quarter and year ended Dec.\xa031,\xa02017. The lower rate for the '
         'fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2018 was primarily due to the '
         'reduction of the federal statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 '
         'percent and the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, '
         'both as a result of the Tax Act enacted in Dec. 2017 . In Dec. 2017 '
         'as a result of the Tax Act, we wrote down our net deferred tax '
         'assets and recorded a net one-time charge of $2.0 billion ( $6.88 '
         'per share in the quarter and $6.77 per share in the year ended '
         '2017), substantially all of which was non-cash. The write-down was '
         'primarily related to re-measurement of certain net deferred tax '
         'assets using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate (approximately '
         '$1 .9\xa0billion), a deemed repatriation tax (approximately $43 '
         'million ), and a reduction in the U.S. manufacturing benefit '
         "(approximately $81\xa0million) as a result of corporation's decision "
         'to accelerate contributions to its pension fund in 2018. Excluding '
         "the net one-time charge, the corporation's effective income tax rate "
         'from continuing operations was 26.9\xa0percent and 26.5\xa0percent '
         'in the quarter and year ended Dec.\xa031,\xa02017. The rate for the '
         "year ended Dec. 31, 2018 also benefited from the corporation's "
         'change in a tax accounting method, recorded discretely in the third '
         'quarter, reflecting a 2012 Court of Federal Claims decision, which '
         'held that the tax basis in certain assets should be increased and '
         "realized upon the assets' disposition. The rates for both periods "
         'benefited from tax deductions for dividends paid to the '
         "corporation's defined contribution plans with an employee stock "
         'ownership plan feature, tax deductions for employee equity awards, '
         'and the research and development tax credit. Pension Transactions In '
         "December 2018 , certain of the corporation's pension plans used "
         'pension trust assets to purchase group annuity contracts from '
         'insurance companies for $2.6 billion . One such contract transferred '
         '$1.8 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations '
         'related to approximately 32,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries to '
         'an insurance company. As a result of this transaction, the insurance '
         'company is now required to pay and administer the retirement '
         'benefits owed to these retirees and beneficiaries. The second\xa0'
         'transaction requires another insurance company to reimburse our '
         'pension trust fund for all future benefit payments\xa0made to '
         'approximately 9,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries under a group '
         'annuity contract purchased for $0.8 billion . Under the terms of '
         'this transaction, the plan will continue to pay and administer the '
         'retirement benefits to these retirees and beneficiaries but will be '
         'reimbursed for all future benefit payments covered by the contract '
         'with no net ongoing cash funding obligation to the plan for the '
         'covered participants as the cost of providing benefits is funded by '
         'the contract. These transactions have no impact on the amount, '
         'timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the '
         'covered retirees and beneficiaries. Additionally, these transactions '
         "did not impact the corporation's earnings or cash flows in 2018. Use "

 'text': 'Perth, Australia – Jan. 29, 2019, Sikorsky, A Lockheed Martin '
         'Company (NYSE: LMT) today announced the relocation of its Forward '
         'Stocking Location (FSL) from Australia’s East Coast in Brisbane to '
         'the West Coast in Perth. The Brisbane FSL opened in 2016 to better '
         'support the flow of parts to customers in Asia-Pacific’s remote '
         'region. \xa0The Forward Stocking Location will continue being '
         'operated by Sikorsky Australia, the regional subsidiary of the '
         'U.S.-based company Sikorsky, providing after-market support '
         'including airframe, component, and rotor blade maintenance along '
         'with material sales, design engineering, non-destructive testing, '
         'and maintenance training throughout the Asia Pacific. Sikorsky '
         'anticipates that moving the FSL from Brisbane to Perth will further '
         'improve the availability of S-92® helicopters in the critical oil '
         'and gas regions in Western Australia and throughout the region. The '
         'company plans to increase stocking volumes at the FSL in Perth '
         'throughout the year. The move is welcomed by operators who service '
         'the oil and gas industry across the Asia Pacific, including on '
         'Australia’s Western Coast. “The move of the Sikorsky FSL to Perth '
         'has been seamless,” said Andrew Cridland, managing director, Babcock '
         'Aviation Offshore Australasia. “Babcock provides a range of services '
         'to blue chip oil & gas companies from a number of remote locations '
         'in Australia, as well as in Dili, Timor-Leste, and we look forward '
         'to continued service and support from Sikorsky’s new facility in '
         'Western Australia.” “Having an FSL in Western Australia is extremely '
         'beneficial for operators like Bristow and the businesses that rely '
         'upon our aircraft,” said Neil Seabrook, engineering manager for '
         'Bristow Asia Pacific Operations. “Bristow provides 24/7 services to '
         'the oil and gas industry in Western Australia. Having an FSL in the '
         'region where we can communicate and work in the same time zone will '
         'have major economic and business and efficiency benefits, not just '
         'for us, but also for our oil and gas customers.” “Having a new FSL '
         'close to our headquarters in Perth and closer to many of our bases '
         'and offshore operations will help us better serve our customers '
         'throughout the region,” said CHC’s Regional Director for the Asia '
         'Pacific market, Vince D’Rozario. “This will help us continue to '
         'ensure our fleet has efficient and effective access to the parts '
         'necessary to keep us flying safely and efficiently.” “The new '
         'Forward Stocking Location in Perth will be instrumental in '
         'supporting our fleet and demonstrates Sikorsky’s commitment to the '
         'Australian offshore oil and gas market,” said PHI, Inc. President '
         'and General Manager, International Oil and Gas, Keith Mullett. '
         'Australia has always been a strategically important region for '
         'Sikorsky’s commercial business, and the regional fleet has grown '
         'significantly to 22 S-92 helicopters totaling more than 40,000 '
         'flight hours over the last decade, with nearly 15,000 hours in 2018. '
         'In addition to the impressive S-92 aircraft presence in Australia, '
         'the FSL is both positioned and equipped to support S-92 and S-76® '
         'aircraft throughout the Asia Pacific. “At Sikorsky Australia, we '
         'pride ourselves on partnering and working with our customers to '
         'understand their requirements.\xa0 Making the decision to relocate '
         'the FSL to Perth Australia will better meet our customers’ needs, '
         'not just in Western Australia but across the Asia Pacific,” said '
         'Sikorsky Australia’s General Manager, Andrew Rushbrook. “We are '
         'seeing increased uptake of Sikorsky aircraft in the Asia Pacific '
         'region, across a range of industries. Relocating the FSL to Western '
         'Australia will improve wait times and increase efficiency for all '
         'our customers, which is a great outcome for us here at Sikorsky '
         'Australia,” said Rushbrook. Since 2016, Lockheed Martin has made '

 'text': 'DENVER , Dec. 23, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- At approximately 12,550 '
         'miles (20,200 km) up...\xa0turn left. You have arrived at a new era '
         'for the Global Positioning System (GPS). A major milestone in the '
         "U.S. Air Force's plan to bring new technology and capabilities to "
         'the GPS constellation, the first Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)-built '
         'GPS III satellite began "talking" with engineers and operators from '
         'ground control, as planned, following its successful launch this '
         'morning. GPS III Space Vehicle 01 (GPS III SV01) is now receiving '
         "and responding to commands from Lockheed Martin's Launch and "
         "Checkout Center at the company's Denver facility. Air Force and "
         'company engineers declared satellite control signal acquisition and '
         'rocket booster separation about\xa0119 minutes after GPS III '
         "SV01's\xa0launch. The satellite lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air "
         'Force Station, Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 8:51 a.m. '
         'EST . GPS III SV01 is the first of an entirely new, next generation '
         'GPS satellite designed to modernize the GPS constellation. GPS III '
         'has three times better accuracy and up to eight times improved '
         'anti-jamming capabilities. Spacecraft life will extend to 15 years, '
         '25 percent longer than any of the GPS satellites on-orbit today. GPS '
         "III's new L1C civil signal will also make it the first GPS satellite "
         'broadcasting a compatible signal with other international global '
         "navigation satellite systems, like Europe's Galileo, improving "
         'connectivity for civilian users. Once declared operational, GPS III '
         "SV01 is expected to take its place in today's 31 satellite strong "
         'GPS constellation, which provides positioning, navigation and timing '
         'services to more than four billion civil, commercial and military '
         'users. The Air Force nicknamed the satellite "Vespucci" after '
         'Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci. "In the coming days, GPS III SV01 '
         'will use its liquid apogee engines to climb into its operational '
         'orbit about 12,550 miles above the earth. We will then send it '
         'commands to deploy its solar arrays and antennas, and begin on-orbit '
         'checkout and tests, including extensive signals testing with our '
         'advanced navigation payload provided by Harris Corporation," said '
         "Johnathon Caldwell , Lockheed Martin's Vice President for Navigation "
         'Systems. Air Force and Lockheed Martin engineers are controlling GPS '
         "III SV01's launch and checkout test using elements of the GPS Next "
         'Generation Operational Control System (OCX) Block 0. Satellite '
         "control and operations are expected to shift to the Air Force's "
         'current Operational Control Segment when GPS III Contingency '
         'Operations upgrades are fully implemented later this year. "This is '
         "the Air Force's first GPS III, so we are excited to begin on-orbit "
         'test and demonstrate its capabilities," Caldwell said. "By this time '
         'next year, we expect to also have a second GPS III on orbit and '
         'users should be receiving signals from this first satellite." '
         'Lockheed Martin developed GPS III and manufactured GPS III SV01 at '
         'its advanced $128-million GPS III Processing Facility near Denver . '
         'In September 2017 , the Air Force declared the satellite "Available '
         'for Launch" (AFL) and had the company place it into storage. Last '
         'summer the Air Force "called up" the satellite for launch and '
         'Lockheed Martin delivered it to Florida on Aug. 20 . On Dec. 8 , GPS '
         'III SV01 completed pre-launch processing, fueling and encapsulation '
         'at Astrotech Space Operations, in Titusville, Florida . GPS III SV01 '
         'is the first of 10 GPS III satellites originally ordered by the Air '
         'Force. GPS III SV03-08 are now in various stages of assembly and '
         'test. In August, the Air Force declared the second GPS III "AFL" '
         'and, in November, called GPS III SV02 up for a 2019 launch. In '
         'September, the Air Force selected Lockheed Martin for the GPS III '
         'Follow On (GPS IIIF) program, an estimated $7.2 billion opportunity '
         'to build up to 22 additional GPS IIIF satellites with additional '
         "capabilities. GPS IIIF builds off Lockheed Martin's existing modular "
         'GPS III, which was designed to evolve with new technology and '
         'changing mission needs. On Sept. 26 , the Air Force awarded Lockheed '
         'Martin a $1.4 billion contract for support to start up the program '
         'and to contract the 11 th and 12 th GPS III satellite. Lockheed '
         "Martin is proud to be a part of the Air Force's GPS III team. The "
         'GPS III team is led by the Global Positioning Systems Directorate at '

         'aboard the United Kingdom’s Vanguard-class submarine as their '
         'nation’s sole nuclear deterrent. Lockheed Martin’s contribution to '
         'the FBM program has been anchored in Sunnyvale, California, since '
         'its inception more than 60 years ago. About Lockheed Martin in '
         'Jefferson County – Lockheed Martin established operations in '
         'Jefferson County in 1955 at the request of the U.S. Air Force. The '
         'Air Force wanted its new rocket facility to be built inland where it '
         'would be less vulnerable to enemy submarine attacks. During this '
         'time, “Industries for Jefferson County” (now Jeffco EDC) was formed '
         'to attract the Glenn L. Martin Company to the county. Over the past '
         '60+ years, Lockheed Martin has been a catalyst for the county’s '
         'aerospace industry. Today, Lockheed Martin is Jefferson County’s '
         'largest private-sector primary employer, with over 6,200 employees. '
         'The company is a huge economic driver for the region, and its '
         'operations in the county indirectly generate 10,000 jobs and bring '
         'billions of dollars to the local economy. Recently, the company '
         'broke ground on its new Gateway Center, which will be a $350 million '
         '266,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art satellite production facility. Upon '
         'completion, Lockheed Martin will have 3.5 million square feet of '

         'Operational Capability\xa0(EOC) status ahead of schedule. After '
         'successfully completing the required integration, flight testing and '
         'modeling and simulation, warfighters accepted the first of many '
         'tactical production units, meeting key criteria for the EOC '
         'declaration milestone. "This event is the culmination of successful '
         'partnerships with the U.S. Air Force, Navy and DARPA," said David '
         'Helsel , LRASM director at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire '
         'Control. "This milestone serves as a great example of collaboration '
         'to bring critical capabilities to the warfighter at accelerated '
         'acquisition timelines." LRASM is designed to detect and destroy '
         'specific targets within groups of ships by employing advanced '
         'technologies that reduce dependence on intelligence, surveillance '
         'and reconnaissance platforms, network links and GPS navigation in '
         'contested environments. LRASM will play a significant role in '
         'ensuring military access to operate in open ocean/blue waters, owing '
         'to its enhanced ability to discriminate and conduct tactical '
         'engagements from extended ranges. LRASM is a precision-guided, '
         'anti-ship standoff missile based on the successful Joint '
         'Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile – Extended Range .\xa0It is designed '
         'to meet the needs of U.S. Navy and Air Force warfighters in '
         'contested environments. The air-launched variant, integrated onboard '
         "the U.S. Air Force's B-1B, provides an early operational capability "
         'meeting the offensive anti-surface warfare Increment I '
         'requirement.\xa0 LRASM is on schedule to achieve EOC on \xa0the U.S. '

         '(NYSE: LMT) delivered the 91 st F-35 aircraft for the year, meeting '
         'the joint government and industry delivery target for 2018 and '
         "demonstrating the F-35 enterprise's ability to ramp to full rate "
         'production. The 91 deliveries in 2018 represent nearly a 40 percent '
         'increase from 2017 and about a 100 percent production increase '
         'compared to 2016. Next year, Lockheed Martin is set to deliver more '

         'production. "This milestone demonstrates the F-35 enterprise is '
         'prepared for full rate production and ready to deliver on increasing '
         'demand from our customers worldwide," said Greg Ulmer , Lockheed '
         'Martin vice president and general manager of the F-35 program. '
         '"Year-over-year, we have increased production, lowered costs, '

         'than 730 pilots and over 6,700 maintainers are trained and the F-35 '
         'fleet has surpassed more than 175,000 cumulative flight hours. Ten '

         "4 th generation aircraft. The F-35's mission readiness and "
         "sustainment costs are also improving. Lockheed Martin's sustainment "
         'cost per aircraft per year decreased three years straight, and by '
         'about 15 percent since 2015. The joint government and industry team '
         'is also taking aggressive actions to\xa0deliver 80 percent mission '
         'capable rates and reduce costs per flight hour by about 40 percent. '
         'With stealth technology, supersonic speed, advanced sensors, weapons '
         'capacity and superior range, the F-35 is the most lethal, survivable '
         'and connected aircraft in the world. More than a fighter jet, the '
         "F-35's ability to collect, analyze and share data, is a powerful "

         'ground-based assets in the battlespace enabling men and women in '

         "Force's first Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)-built GPS III satellite is "
         'now encapsulated for its planned December 18 launch from Cape '
         'Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida , on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. '
         'GPS III Space Vehicle 01 (GPS III SV01) underwent pre-launch '
         'processing, fueling and encapsulation at Astrotech Space Operations '
         ', in Titusville, Florida . During encapsulation, GPS III SV01 was '
         'sealed in its launch fairing, an aerodynamic, nose-cone shell that '
         'protects the satellite during launch. In the coming days, the '
         'fairing-enclosed satellite will be mounted to the rocket as launch '
         'preparations continue. GPS III SV01 is the first of an entirely new '
         'design of GPS satellite which will help the Air Force modernize '
         "today's GPS constellation with new technology and advanced "
         'capabilities. GPS III has three times better accuracy and up to '
         'eight times improved anti-jamming capabilities. Spacecraft life will '
         'extend to 15 years, 25 percent longer than any of the GPS satellites '
         "on-orbit today. GPS III's new L1C civil signal also will make it the "
         'first GPS satellite broadcasting a compatible signal with other '
         'international global navigation satellite systems, like Galileo, '
         'improving connectivity for civilian users. "The world is dependent '
         'on GPS. More than four billion military, commercial and civilian '
         'users connect with signals generated by GPS satellites every day," '
         "said Johnathon Caldwell , Lockheed Martin's Vice President for "
         'Navigation Systems. "The launch of GPS III SV01 will be the first '
         "step in modernizing the Air Force's GPS constellation with the most "
         'powerful and resilient GPS satellites ever designed and built." '
         'Lockheed Martin developed GPS III and manufactured GPS III SV01 at '
         'its advanced $128-million GPS III Processing Facility near Denver . '
         'In September 2017 , the Air Force declared the satellite "Available '
         'for Launch" (AFL) and had the company place it into storage. Last '
         'Summer the Air Force "called up" the satellite for launch and '
         'Lockheed Martin delivered it to Florida on August 20 . The Air Force '
         'nicknamed the satellite "Vespucci" after Italian explorer Amerigo '
         'Vespucci. GPS III SV01 is the first of 10 GPS III satellites '
         'originally ordered by the Air Force. GPS III SV03-08 are now in '
         'various stages of assembly and test. In August, the Air Force '
         'declared the second GPS III "AFL" and, in November, called GPS III '
         'SV02 up for 2019 launch. In September, the Air Force selected '
         'Lockheed Martin for the GPS III Follow On (GPS IIIF) program, an '
         'estimated $7.2 billion opportunity to build up to 22 additional GPS '
         'IIIF satellites with additional capabilities. GPS IIIF builds off '
         "Lockheed Martin's existing modular GPS III, which was designed to "
         'evolve with new technology and changing mission needs. On Sept. 26 , '
         'the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin a $1.4 billion contract for '
         'support to start up the program and to contract the 11 th and 12 th '

         "PRNewswire / --\xa0Australia's first two locally-based F-35 fighter "
         'aircraft arrived on home soil today at Royal Australian Air Force '
         '(RAAF) Williamtown, signalling the dawn of a new era for the '
         "nation's defence capabilities. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) designed "
         "and built Australia's fleet of F-35s and also serves as the global "
         'industry lead for F-35 sustainment. The most advanced fighter jet '
         'ever built, the F-35 will be a catalyst for the transformation of '
         'the Australian Defence Force (ADF), utilising its sensors and low '
         'observability to operate with impunity in contested airspace and '
         'fuse a picture of the battlespace for other air, land and sea '
         'assets. Along with its advanced weapons capacity and superior range, '
         'the 5 th Generation F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and '
         'connected fighter in the world. "The arrival of the first F-35 '
         'aircraft to be permanently based in Australia is a historic occasion '
         'and we are proud of our role as the 5 th Generation design pioneer '
         'and F-35 original equipment manufacturer," said Chief Executive of '
         'Lockheed Martin Australia, Vince Di Pietro AM , CSC. "We '
         'congratulate the RAAF, the ADF and all of our Australian industry '
         'partners who have worked to make this achievement a reality." '
         'Australia Plays Major Role in the F-35 Program Australian suppliers '
         'play a significant role in the F-35 program with more than 50 '
         'Australian companies contributing to the global program of record of '
         'more than 3,000 aircraft. To date, the F-35 program has secured more '
         'than 2,400 highly skilled jobs created and generated more than $1.3 '
         'billion AUD in contracts for Australian industry. "Flown by '
         'Australian pilots, maintained by Australian maintenance personnel '
         'and containing many best-of-breed advanced components made right '
         'here in Australia , all Australians have every reason to be proud of '
         'this achievement," Di Pietro said. " Australia plays a significant '
         'role in the program with a suite of local industrial technology and '
         'know-how behind the hundreds of F-35s flying today, as well as the '
         'thousands of F-35s that will be produced in the future." Lockheed '
         'Martin is the industry lead for F-35 global sustainment and is '
         'working in partnership with the Australian Defence Force and local '
         'industry to provide sustainment support and realise the full '
         'potential of the F-35 as an integrated force multiplier for decades '
         "to come. Australia's has committed to\xa072 F-35As, which will be "
         'flown by Australian pilots, and maintained by a joint team of '
         'Australian maintenance personnel and industry partners including '
         'Lockheed Martin Australia. Australia has received 10 aircraft to '
         'date, the remainder of which are stationed at Luke Air Force Base in '
         'Arizona where they are part of the international cooperative F-35 '
         'training operations. F-35 Program Grows Global Impact Ten nations '
         "are currently flying F-35s, and with today's arrival, Australia "
         'becomes the 7th nation with F-35 aircraft based locally on their '
         'home soil, joining the United States , United Kingdom , Italy , '
         'Norway , Israel and Japan . Additionally, with the formal stand-up '
         'of RAAF Williamtown, F-35s are now operating from 16 bases '
         'worldwide. More than 340 F-35s are operating today, more than 700 '

         'Universal Synaptics Corporation signed an agreement to help the U.S. '
         'Department of Defense (DoD) tackle an issue known as intermittent '
         'fault anomaly. A new automated testing technology, developed by '
         'Universal Synaptics, called Intermittent Fault Detection discovers '
         'random fault anomalies in multi-domain platform electronics as well '
         'as wiring harnesses. This issue currently drives an estimated $2 '
         'billion in annual DoD maintenance costs. This system increases '
         'platform mission capable rates by eliminating unnecessary follow-on '
         'maintenance and proactively addressing emerging issues. This new '
         'capability isolates each intermittent fault and provides '
         'easy-to-follow maintenance actions for the maintainer to return the '
         'unit back into service. In addition to mission capable improvements, '
         'eliminating intermittent failures will dramatically reduce '
         'sustainment costs by keeping platforms operating and decreasing '
         'repairs and supply support. “This new capability is groundbreaking, '
         'and we’re tremendously excited to help the DoD address a challenge '
         'costing them billions,” said Laura Frank, vice president of Lockheed '
         'Martin Enterprise Sustainment Solutions. “Resolving intermittence in '
         'electronics is a discriminator for the DoD in achieving an '
         '80-percent Mission Capable rate across platforms.” Together, the '
         'team will identify solutions for the DoD with the Intermittent Fault '
         'Detection & Isolation System 2.0™ (IFDIS2™), the Voyager '
         'Intermittent Fault Detector™ (VIFD™) and the associated Interface '
         'and Application (IA) solutions. This next-generation, integrated '
         'system is used to detect intermittent faults in nearly any piece of '
         'electronic equipment or wiring on any platform including F-22, F-16, '
         'F-35, F/A-18, rotary platforms such as the UH-60 as well as land and '
         'sea platforms. “This partnership aligns our collective goals of '
         'reducing No Fault Found and increasing warfighter readiness by '
         'eradicating intermittent faults,” said Ken Anderson, Universal '
         'Synaptics Corporation President and CEO. “Together we will define a '
         'new era of advanced test capabilities and reset test equipment '

 'text': 'DENVER , Nov. 29, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) '
         'will apply its expertise in interplanetary spacecraft to a new '
         'program designed to deliver commercial payloads to the surface of '
         "the Moon. NASA announced today they have selected Lockheed Martin's "
         'McCandless Lunar Lander to provide payload delivery services as part '
         "of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract. "
         "Lockheed Martin's lander design builds on four decades of experience "
         'engineering deep space missions, including Mars landers. The '
         'McCandless Lunar Lander is based on the proven design of the InSight '
         'lander – which just touched down on the Martian surface on Monday, '
         'Nov. 26 – and the Phoenix lander – which successfully arrived at '
         'Mars in May 2008 . "We are excited to leverage our interplanetary '
         'lander designs and experience to help NASA build a new economy on '
         'and around the Moon, and beyond," said Lisa Callahan , vice '
         'president and general manager for Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed '
         'Martin. "Lockheed Martin has built more interplanetary spacecraft '
         'than all other U.S. companies combined, including four successful '
         'Mars landers. With our expertise on Orion and the NextSTEP lunar '
         'habitat, we can maximize the value of CLPS for lunar science '
         "operations as well as the path forward to tomorrow's reusable human "
         'lander." The McCandless Lunar Lander is capable of transporting '
         'large payloads weighing hundreds of kilograms – including stationary '
         'scientific instruments, deployable rovers, or even sample return '
         'vehicles – to the surface of the Moon. The lander uses a proven '
         'propulsive landing approach that relies upon on-board radars and a '
         'set of rocket thrusters firing 10 times a second to slow to just '
         'five mph before touching down. Once on the lunar surface, the lander '
         'can provide power, communications and thermal management for '
         'sophisticated payloads. "We\'re no stranger to commercial space '
         'business models, having built more than 100 commercial satellites '
         'and launched numerous Atlas and Titan commercial payloads," said '
         'Callahan. "On our last 10 interplanetary missions for NASA, we '
         'delivered on or ahead of schedule, and on budget. We want to assure '
         'payload customers who select Lockheed Martin can be confident that '
         'we\'ll deliver on-time and on-budget." The McCandless Lunar Lander '
         'is named in honor of the late Bruce McCandless , a NASA astronaut '
         'and longtime Lockheed Martin employee who was a pioneer in space '
         'exploration. McCandless is best known for conducting the first ever '
         'untethered spacewalk using the Lockheed Martin-built Manned '
         'Maneuvering Unit during a flight on the space shuttle. He originally '
         'joined the astronaut corps during the Apollo program and served as '
         "the voice of mission control for Neil Armstrong's famous moonwalk. "
         'After retiring from NASA he was instrumental in the design of '
         'exploration technology and training the next generation of planetary '
         'explorers during his tenure at Lockheed Martin. About Lockheed '

 'text': 'Toronto, December 3, 2018 – Forge Hydrocarbons Corporation (FORGE) '
         'today announced that it has received a $4 million USD investment '
         'from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) under the Industrial and '
         'Technological Benefits (ITB) Policy.\xa0 This investment enables '
         'Forge, a Canadian, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) company '
         'to further develop\xa0its Lipid-to-Hydrocarbon (LTH) technology and '
         'to construct a first-of-kind, commercial plant with a production '
         'capacity of approximately 19 million liters per year (ML/y). FORGE’s '
         'LTH proprietary production technology produces drop-in, renewable '
         'fuels that are indistinguishable from petroleum-based fuels and that '
         'are directly compatible with the current petroleum-based fuel '
         'infrastructure. Renewable fuels are an extremely important element '
         'in any country’s strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and to '
         'adhere with the Clean Fuel Standard to reduce Canada’s greenhouse '
         'gas emissions by 30 megatons by the year 2030. \xa0FORGE’s LTH '
         'technology reduces green house gas emissions by over 70% compared to '
         'petroleum-based fuels. Lockheed Martin’s investment is in direct '
         'support of its ITB obligations associated with Canada’s purchase of '
         '17 CC-130J Super Hercules aircraft, which were delivered to the '
         'Royal Canadian Air Force in 2010. Lockheed Martin also delivers '
         'continued In-Service Support for the CC-130J fleet. The LTH process '
         'emerged from decades of high temperature chemistry research and was '
         'invented by Dr. David Bressler a Professor in the Faculty of '
         'Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences at the University of '
         'Alberta in Edmonton Alberta.\xa0 Early research and the construction '
         'of the first pilot facility was supported through grants from the '
         'Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the '
         'Province of Alberta, MITACS and Alberta Innovates as well as large '
         'investments by the Alberta Livestock and Meat Agency and Western '
         'Economic Diversification Canada.\xa0 The SOMBRA LTH Facility is '
         'being supported by a $4.2 million contribution by Sustainable '
         'Development Technology Canada. “FORGE is extraordinarily pleased to '
         'have this investment from Lockheed Martin under the ITB '
         'Framework.\xa0 Lockheed Martin’s investment not only adds to the '
         'validation received to date for the LTH technology buy also provides '
         'a necessary monetary boost to FORGE’s commercialization pathway”, '
         'said FORGE CEO Tim Haig.\xa0 Owing to Lockheed Martin’s investment, '
         'Forge has begun final engineering design and site preparation for '
         'the first LTH plant to be built in Sombra Ontario.\xa0 FORGE expects '
         'to break-ground on this first LTH plant in 2018. This project '
         'funding will also contribute to the continuation of research and '
         'development, at the University of Alberta and Forge’s pilot facility '
         'in Edmonton, Alberta, to increase the efficiency of the technology '
         'and to broaden the scope of the application to a wider range of feed '

 'text': 'SEATTLE—BETHESDA—(BUSINESS WIRE)—November 27, 2018 — Today at AWS '
         're:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company '
         '(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) announced a strategic '
         'collaboration to integrate the new AWS Ground Station service with '
         'Lockheed Martin’s new Verge antenna network. AWS and Lockheed Martin '
         'are bringing these two highly capable systems together to provide a '
         'solution that addresses customer needs for resilient satellite '
         'uplinks and downlinks. Through this integration, customers using AWS '
         'Ground Station gain the ability to download data from multiple '
         'satellites at the same time and to continue downloading data even '
         'when unplanned outages like a weather event impact parts of the '
         'network. And, Lockheed Martin Verge customers benefit from being '
         'able to upload satellite commands and data through AWS Ground '
         'Station and to quickly download large amounts of data over the '
         'high-speed AWS Ground Station network. Both Lockheed Martin Verge '
         'and AWS Ground Station customers can now integrate satellite data '
         'with the rich portfolio of AWS services, including compute, storage, '
         'analytics, and machine learning. To learn more, please visit '
         'www.lockheedmartin.com/Verge and '
         'https://aws.amazon.com/ground-station . Immediate and continuous '
         'access to the latest satellite data is critical in use cases such as '
         'public safety, military missions in fast-evolving threat '
         'environments, and real-time weather observations for cargo ships and '
         'airlines. Today, there are thousands of satellites orbiting the '
         'earth and collecting data, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) '
         'satellites, which are ideal for collecting data for Earth '
         'observation and currently comprise about 63 percent of the active '
         'satellites now in orbit, according to United Nations data. '
         'Traditionally, government organizations or enterprises who have '
         'required access to satellite data needed to build or lease ground '
         'antennas to communicate with the satellites at significant cost and '
         'effort. Further, customers often require antennas in multiple '
         'countries and U.S. locations to download data when and where they '
         'need it without waiting for the satellite to pass over a desired '
         'location. All of this requires significant capital investments and '
         'operational costs to build, manage, and maintain antennas, compute '
         'infrastructure, and business logic at each antenna location. By '
         'combining Lockheed Martin’s distributed network of satellite '
         'receivers with direct AWS Ground Station access, the two companies '
         'are delivering a next-generation space solution that will help '
         'address the growing need for satellite ground communications and '
         'data management while reducing capacity constraints and enabling '
         'satellite customers to scale their satellite data downlinks in '
         'real-time to meet unanticipated demand across a broad variety of '
         'situations. “Together, AWS and Lockheed Martin are providing '
         'satellite operators increased flexibility, resiliency, and scale in '
         'a complete connectivity solution, ground architecture, and cloud '
         'environment for integrated satellite and data management '
         'operations,” said Rick Ambrose, Executive Vice President of Lockheed '
         'Martin Space. “Our collaboration with AWS allows us to deliver '
         'robust ground communications that will unlock new benefits for '
         'environmental research, scientific studies, security operations, and '
         'real-time news media. In time, with satellites built to take full '
         'advantage of the distributed Verge network, AWS and Lockheed Martin '
         'expect to see customers develop surprising new capabilities using '
         'the service.” “AWS and Lockheed Martin have a long, deep '
         'relationship and over the past several years it’s become apparent '
         'that together we could bring greater capabilities to our public '
         'sector and commercial customers,” said Teresa Carlson, Vice '
         'President, Worldwide Public Sector for AWS. “Today we are taking the '
         'next step in this relationship. The integration of AWS Ground '
         'Station with Lockheed Martin Verge brings the unique capabilities of '
         'both companies to mutual customers, enabling them to control '
         'satellites across both networks and downlink data faster with more '
         'resiliency.” Because many AWS Ground Station antennas are co-located '
         'with AWS Regions, both AWS and Lockheed Martin customers gain '
         'low-latency, local access to other AWS services to process and store '
         'this data. For example, they can use Amazon EC2 to control '
         'satellites and downlink data, store and share the data in Amazon '
         'Elastic Block Store, Amazon Elastic File System, or Amazon S3, use '
         'AWS Virtual Private Cloud for secure communications between Amazon '
         'EC2 instances and the AWS Ground Station antenna gateway, hunt for '
         'real-time business insights with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and '
         'Amazon Elastic Map Reduce, apply machine learning algorithms and '
         'models with Amazon SageMaker, add image analysis with Amazon '
         'Rekognition, and improve data sets by combining satellite data with '
         'IoT sensor data from AWS IoT Greengrass. AWS customers can combine '
         'these capabilities to build exciting applications that might use '
         'image recognition to identify and protect endangered animals, '
         'machine learning to predict faulty construction or industrial '
         'systems, or analytics to estimate oil production or assess '
         'agriculture yields in real time. “Access to geospatial information '
         'gives customers the confidence to make critical decisions. For space '
         'startups like Spire Global, AWS and Lockheed Martin are unlocking '
         'the potential of nearly continuous and uninterrupted access to '
         'satellite data along with the ability to analyze and leverage that '
         'data using the broad and deep cloud services available in AWS,” said '
         'Robert W. Sproles, Ph.D. and Program Manager, Ground Stations, for '
         'Spire Global, Inc. “The combination of Lockheed Martin Verge and AWS '
         'Cloud will allow multiple satellites to\xa0downlink\xa0'
         'simultaneously, which will increase satellite constellation '
         'throughput and reduce latency for our customers.” Customers can '
         'easily request Lockheed Martin Verge as their preferred downlink '
         'directly through the AWS Ground Station console or from the Verge '
         'management console. Once Lockheed Martin Verge receives and '
         'processes satellite data, customers can access it directly in their '
         'virtual private cloud (VPC) in AWS Regions. For AWS customers in the '
         'government or regulated industries, this includes the AWS GovCloud '
         'and Secret Regions that carry the full range of data '
         'classifications, including Unclassified, Sensitive, Secret, and Top '
         'Secret. Lockheed Martin Verge will be available in private beta '
         'today for customers with satellites that support S-band frequencies '
         'and can downlink in the Denver, Colorado area. General availability '
         'and expansion to the higher frequency X-band will be announced in '
         'the future. About Amazon Web Services For over 12 years, Amazon Web '

 'text': 'ORLANDO, Fla. , Nov. 27, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE: LMT) today announced a $1.5 million contribution to the '
         'University of Central Florida (UCF) for the development of a new '
         'cyber innovation lab that will foster the next generation of cyber '
         'talent. The Lockheed Martin Cyber Innovation Lab ensures UCF remains '
         "on the forefront of educating and empowering our nation's future "
         'cyber experts. UCF provides more graduates to aerospace and defense '
         "companies than any other university in the country, and UCF's Cyber "
         'Defense Club is a three-time national champion in the Collegiate '
         'Cyber Defense Competition. "Our contribution is an investment in the '
         'future of students at UCF, the city of Orlando and the broader '
         'aerospace community," said Tom Warner , director of Lockheed '
         'Martin\'s Cyber Defense, Range and Resilience organization. "The '
         'nation is facing a challenge filling the pipeline of cyber talent, '
         'and we see it as our duty to partner with communities, our customers '
         'and academia to create resources that inspire and prepare young '
         'people for a career in this critical field." "This state-of-the-art '
         'space will help better prepare our students to safeguard and '
         'strengthen our country\'s systems and networks," said UCF President '
         'Dale Whittaker . "We are grateful for Lockheed Martin\'s vision and '
         'partnership as we work together to meet the cyber security workforce '
         'demands of the future." The innovation lab will open its doors in '
         'early 2019 to more than 350 students participating in cyber programs '
         "at UCF, expanding the pipeline for the nation's future cyber talent. "
         "The 970-foot lab, which will be located in the atrium of UCF's "
         'Engineering I building, will serve as a learning hub, classroom and '
         "the practice center for UCF's Cyber Defense Club. A public ribbon "
         'cutting ceremony and associated Cyber Security Summit is planned for '
         'February 2019 . According to a recent study published by the '
         "National Institute of Standards and Technology, there's a dangerous "
         'shortage of cybersecurity workers in the United States , with more '
         'than 13,000 unfilled cybersecurity jobs in Florida alone. For '
         'example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects jobs for information '
         'security analysts to grow by 28 percent by 2026, four times greater '
         'than average job growth. Florida is one of the top five states in '
         "the country for information security employment. Lockheed Martin's "
         'Cyber Solutions business in Orlando has grown by 400 percent over '
         'the past five years and continues to grow in response to the '
         "nation's critical need for offensive and defensive cyber security "
         "capabilities in today's evolving threat environment. Lockheed Martin "
         'provides paid work experience to approximately 650 UCF students a '
         'year and hires more graduates from UCF than any other university in '

         'equatorial region of Mars. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor '
         'responsible for the complete spacecraft system – cruise stage, '
         'aeroshell and the lander itself. Mission management and navigation '
         'were handled by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and spacecraft '
         "operations were performed by engineers at Lockheed Martin Space's "
         'Mission Support Area in Littleton, Colorado . At 12:47 p.m. MST , '
         'onboard software commands, developed by Lockheed Martin, fired six '
         'separation nuts and jettisoned the cruise stage of the spacecraft '
         'while it was 78 miles above the surface. That started a series of '
         'events that took the spacecraft through six different configurations '
         'and from a speed of 12,300 mph to a gentle touchdown on the surface. '
         'The data signal confirming the spacecraft had successfully landed '
         'was received on Earth at 12:52 p.m. MST . "The InSight lander is a '
         'remarkable spacecraft. Through the entire entry, descent and landing '
         'it performed flawlessly," said Stu Spath , InSight program manager '

         '"NASA\'s JPL, which has been a pioneer in Mars exploration for '
         'decades, partners with both academia and private industry to bring '
         'the best expertise and innovation forward to make important '

         'spacecraft waited approximately seven minutes to use its X-band '
         'small deep space transponder to send a tone confirming the health of '
         'the spacecraft. Then, 25 minutes after that, the lander deployed its '
         'two solar arrays, with a width of 19 feet, 8 inches, to begin '

         'data during its journey to the surface, and will send it back to '
         'Earth later today. Both MRO and Odyssey will provide UHF relay '
         'during the entirety of the InSight surface mission – Odyssey in the '
         'morning and MRO in the afternoon. Both MRO and Odyssey spacecraft '
         'were built by Lockheed Martin and both are operated for JPL by the '

 'text': 'ANNAPOLIS, Md. , Nov. 17, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- The U.S. Navy '
         "commissioned USS Sioux City (LCS 11) – the nation's sixth "
         'Freedom-variant Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) – at the United States '
         'Naval Academy today. This milestone places the ship, built by '
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), into active service. Unique among '
         'combat ships, LCS is designed to complete close-to-shore missions '
         'and is a growing and relevant part of the Navy\'s fleet. "We are '
         'confident that LCS 11 will be what the Navy needs, when the fleet '
         'needs it," said Joe DePietro , vice president, Small Combatants and '
         'Ship Systems, Lockheed Martin. "We remain focused on delivering '
         'these ships as quickly as possible with increasing capability and '
         "lethality. These ships will have a long lifespan, and we're working "
         'with the Navy to make LCS even stronger and more resilient." The '
         'Freedom-variant LCS integrates new technology and capability to '
         'affordably support current and future mission capability from deep '
         'water to the littorals. LCS 11 is equipped to support surface '
         'warfare. LCS continues to increase in capability. This year, LCS 5 '
         'and 7 completed Longbow Hellfire missile testing, LCS 9 completed '
         'RAM testing and LCS 5 and 9 participated in Fleet Weeks around the '
         'United States . The Freedom-variant LCS is designed to integrate '
         'modular weapons, as well as manned and unmanned vehicles to deliver '
         'critical warfighting capability to the fleet in mine counter '
         'measures, anti-surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare. "LCS is '
         'our most effective fleet asset to counter asymmetric small craft '
         'threats," said Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral John Richardson . '
         '"This ship and the ships like her are going to complicate any '
         "adversary's operating picture. You're going to need to keep track of "
         "Sioux City when she's at sea, because if you don't, she's going to "
         'make you pay for that." There are seven ships in various stages of '
         'production and test at Fincantieri Marinette Marine, where the '
         'Freedom-variant LCS is built. The next Freedom-variant in the class '
         'is LCS 13, the future USS Wichita, slated for commissioning in '
         'Mayport, Florida , in January. LCS 19 is scheduled for christening '
         'on Dec. 15 . "Two thousand men and women crafted this ship from flat '
         'steel to the capable and agile surface combatant being commissioned. '
         'The men and women who sail this ship have an enormous responsibility '
         'in protecting our nation and allies, and we consider it a privilege '
         'to support these missions," said Jan Allman , President and CEO of '
         'Fincantieri Marinette Marine. "I am confident that when called upon, '

 'text': 'COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado, Nov. 14, 2018 – Colorado students will '
         'soon have a chance to visit Mars thanks to Lockheed Martin (NYSE: '
         'LMT). The company announced a $150,000 grant which will provide the '
         'Challenger Learning Center of Colorado Springs with a '
         'next-generation Mission to Mars upgrade for its spacecraft and '
         'mission control simulator. The grant will allow students to '
         'participate in “Expedition Mars,” a new, immersive mission module '
         'that challenges future astronauts to work together in search of '
         'signs of water on the Red Planet. The missions will provide hands-on '
         'labs, such as robotics navigation and oxygen testing; exposure to '
         'major Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) concepts; and '
         'an introduction to academic paths and career connections in '
         'aerospace. The new module is possible through a major upgrade of the '
         'Challenger Center’s 16-year-old interactive simulator software and '
         'hardware. This upgrade, and training of the Center’s staff on the '
         'new system, is made possible by the Lockheed Martin grant. The new '
         'Expedition to Mars mission module will be available to students in '
         'October 2019. This type of training and development of the next '
         'generation of scientists, engineers and explorers is important to '
         'Lockheed Martin. “From landing NASA’s first spacecraft on Mars in '
         '1976 to landing the next spacecraft on Mars in two weeks, Lockheed '
         'Martin Space has built spacecraft and systems that have explored '
         'every planet in our solar system,” said Kay Sears, Lockheed Martin’s '
         'vice president for Military Space. “To continue this proud legacy, '
         'we are going to need a lot more engineers and scientists in the '
         'future. This investment in the Challenger Center now is just the '
         'smart thing to do.” “Thanks to Lockheed Martin, it is expected that '
         'our next-generation spacecraft simulator will take more than 400,000 '
         'students into space and to Mars over the next 50 years,” said Robert '
         'Fredell, President & CEO of the Challenger Center. “Lockheed '
         'Martin’s contribution will help us continue to be the leading '
         'informal STEM education center in southern Colorado, inspiring youth '
         'in math, science, engineering and technology careers.” Following the '
         'check presentation, 7 th graders from the Vanguard School in '
         'Colorado Springs demonstrated a “Rendezvous with a Comet” mission on '
         'the Challenger Center’s existing simulator. The simulator and '
         'Center’s staff have delivered space exploration inspiration to more '
         'than 200,000 Colorado school children since the educational facility '
         'opened its doors in 2002. Lockheed Martin Space, headquartered near '
         'Denver, continues to be a leader in the space industry. Current '
         'projects include: operating eight spacecraft for NASA, with the '
         'newest, the InSight Mars Lander scheduled to land on the Red Planet '
         'on November 26; building the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation GPS '
         'III satellites , the first of which is scheduled to launch in '
         'December; and building NASA’s Orion spacecraft , the world’s only '
         'exploration-class spaceship that will take humans out into deep '
         'space, including the Moon and Mars. About The Challenger Learning '
         'Center: The Challenger Learning Center of Colorado’s mission is to '
         'inspire and engage elementary and middle school students in science, '
         'technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subject areas, using '
         'exciting, hands-on, “team STEM” programs. The Center is part of a '
         'network of Challenger Centers founded by the families of the '
         'astronauts lost in the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in 1986, to '

 'text': 'DENVER , Nov. 16, 2018 / PRNewswire / --\xa0TAGSAM, or Touch-and-Go '
         'Sample Acquisition Mechanism, completed a successful practice '
         'deployment in space on Nov. 14—an important milestone in the '
         'OSIRIS-REx mission to the asteroid Bennu. TAGSAM is the '
         'first-of-its-kind robotic arm and sampling head invented by Lockheed '
         'Martin. Lockheed Martin engineers on the Mission Support Area (MSA) '
         "team moved TAGSAM's arm through the full range of motion of all its "
         '"joints"—shoulder, elbow and wrist. The maneuver demonstrates that '
         'TAGSAM is ready to collect surface material (regolith) from Bennu. '
         '"Our team has been providing spacecraft operations since launch and '
         'has been conducting various checkouts over the past two years," said '
         'Sandy Freund , Lockheed Martin OSIRIS-REx MSA manager. "This was a '
         'very important milestone in checking out the hardware required to '
         'collect an asteroid sample." Lockheed Martin engineers spent more '
         'than a decade designing, building and testing TAGSAM. The mechanism '
         'meets the unique challenges of trying to collect samples from the '
         'smallest planetary body that a spacecraft has ever orbited. The '
         'OSIRIS-REx spacecraft cannot land on Bennu because of its small '
         'size—just 0.3 miles (500 meters) in diameter--and its microgravity '
         "environment—100,000 times less than Earth's. Instead, TAGSAM will "
         'extend its 11-foot-long (3.35-meter) arm from the spacecraft to '
         'Bennu\'s surface and "tag" the asteroid. The round sampler head will '
         'agitate the surface and loosen regolith with a jet of nitrogen gas, '
         'allowing the suspend\xaded particles to pass through a filter into '
         'the sampler head. The entire operation will take about five seconds, '
         'with the TAGSAM head bouncing against the surface in a '
         'pogo-stick-type motion. If necessary, TAGSAM can make up to three '
         'sampling attempts to collect at least 2.1 ounces (60 grams) of '
         'regolith. "First-of-its-kind innovations like this one serve as the '
         'precursor for future missions to small bodies," said Freund. '
         '"Proving out these technologies and techniques, we are going to be '
         'able to return the largest sample from space in half a century and '
         'pave the way for other missions." TAGSAM began its journey aboard '
         'OSIRIS-REx on Sept. 8, 2016 . The spacecraft is scheduled to reach '
         'Bennu on Dec. 3, 2018 , and complete a survey of the asteroid over '
         'the next two years. The window for the touch-and-go sampling '
         'operation opens on July 4, 2020 . Once enough sample is collected, '
         "the TAGSAM head will be stowed and sealed in the spacecraft's sample "
         'return capsule (SRC) for the return trip to Earth, with expected '
         'arrival on Sept. 24, 2023 . NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in '
         'Greenbelt provides overall mission management, systems engineering '
         'and safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx. Dante Lauretta of '
         'the University of Arizona , Tucson , is the principal investigator, '
         'and the University of Arizona also leads the science team and the '

 'text': 'SUNNYVALE, Calif., Oct. 30, 2018 – The Missile Defense Agency '
         'awarded Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) a nine month, $25.5 million '
         'contract extension to continue development of its Low Power Laser '
         'Demonstrator (LPLD) missile interceptor concept. This program, '
         'awarded Aug. 31, builds on a 2017 contract to develop an initial '
         'LPLD concept. Lockheed Martin’s LPLD concept consists of a fiber '
         'laser system on a high-performing, high-altitude airborne platform. '
         'LPLD is designed to engage missiles during their boost phase — the '
         'short window after launch — which is the ideal time to destroy the '
         'threat, before it can deploy multiple warheads and decoys. Over the '
         'course of this contract, Lockheed Martin will mature its LPLD '
         'concept to a tailored critical design review phase, which will bring '
         'the design to a level that can support full-scale fabrication. “We '
         'have made great progress on our LPLD design, and in this stage we '
         'are particularly focused on maturing our technology for beam control '
         '– the ability to keep the laser beam stable and focused at '
         'operationally relevant ranges,” said Sarah Reeves, vice president '
         'for Missile Defense Programs at Lockheed Martin Space. “LPLD is one '
         'of many breakthrough capabilities the Missile Defense Agency is '
         'pursuing to stay ahead of rapidly-evolving threats, and we’re '
         'committed to bringing together Lockheed Martin’s full expertise in '
         'directed energy for this important program.” Lockheed Martin expands '
         'on advanced technology through its laser device, beam control '
         'capabilities, and platform integration – ranging from internal '
         'research and development investments in systems like ATHENA to '
         'programs such as LANCE for the Air Force Research Laboratory. '
         'Continued LPLD development will take place at Lockheed Martin’s '
         'Sunnyvale, California campus through July 2019. As a proven world '
         'leader in systems integration and development of air and missile '
         'defense systems and technologies, Lockheed Martin delivers '
         'high-quality missile defense solutions that protect citizens, '
         'critical assets and deployed forces from current and future threats. '
         "The company's experience spans directed energy systems development, "
         'missile design and production, hit-to-kill capabilities, infrared '
         'seekers, command and control/battle management, and communications, '
         'precision pointing and tracking optics, radar and signal processing, '
         'as well as threat-representative targets for missile defense tests. '

         'systems to complete missions and improve safety," said Chris Van '
         'Buiten , vice president, Sikorsky Innovations. "We could not be more '
         'thrilled to welcome Army aviators to the cockpit to experience '
         'first-hand the reliability of optimally-piloted technology developed '
         'by the innovative engineers at Sikorsky and DARPA. These aviators '
         'experienced the same technology that we are installing and testing '
         'on a Black Hawk that will take its first flight over the next '
         'several months." SARA, which has more than 300 hours of autonomous '
         'flight, successfully demonstrated the advanced capabilities '
         "developed as part of the third phase of DARPA's Aircrew Labor "
         'In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program. The aircraft was '
         'operated at different times by pilots on board and pilots on the '
         "ground. Sikorsky's MATRIX™ Technology autonomous software and "
         'hardware, which is installed on SARA, executed various scenarios '
         'including: The recent Mission Software Flight Demonstration was a '
         "collaboration with the U.S. Army's Aviation Development Directorate, "
         'Sikorsky and DARPA. The Army and DARPA are working with Sikorsky to '
         'improve and expand ALIAS capabilities developed as a tailorable '
         'autonomy kit for installation in both fixed wing airplanes and '
         'helicopters. View the video from the demonstration . Over the next '
         'few months, Sikorsky will for the first time fly a Black Hawk '
         'equipped with ALIAS. The company is working closely with the Federal '
         'Aviation Administration to certify ALIAS/MATRIX technology so that '
         'it will be available on current and future commercial and military '
         'aircraft. "We\'re demonstrating a certifiable autonomy solution that '
         'is going to drastically change the way pilots fly," said Mark Ward , '
         'Sikorsky Chief Pilot, Stratford, Conn. Flight Test Center. "We\'re '
         'confident that MATRIX Technology will allow pilots to focus on their '
         'missions. This technology will ultimately decrease instances of the '
         'number one cause of helicopter crashes: Controlled Flight Into '
         'Terrain (CFIT)." Through the DARPA ALIAS program, Sikorsky is '
         'developing an OPV approach it describes as pilot directed autonomy '
         'that will give operators the confidence to fly aircraft safely, '
         'reliably and affordably in optimally piloted modes enabling flight '

         'Weapon System detected, tracked, engaged and launched a missile to '
         'intercept a Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) target. The test, '
         'called Flight Test Standard Missile–45, demonstrated the integrated '
         'capabilities of the Aegis Weapon System and how it has continually '
         'evolved to counter advanced threats. This test demonstrated the new '

         'pension cost of approximately $2.4 billion and expected financial '
         'accounting standards (FAS) pension expense of approximately $1.4 '
         'billion. CAS pension cost and the service cost component of FAS '
         'pension expense will be included in operating profit as part of cost '
         'of sales. The non-service cost component of FAS pension expense will '
         "be included in non-operating expense on the corporation's "
         'consolidated statement of earnings. For additional detail on the '
         "corporation's FAS/CAS pension adjustment see the supplemental table "
         'included at the end of this news release. 2019 Financial Trends The '
         'corporation expects its 2019 net sales to increase by approximately '
         '5.0 percent to 6.0 percent as compared to the 2018 outlook. Total '
         'business segment operating margin in 2019 is expected to be in the '
         '10.5 percent to 10.8 percent range and cash from operations is '
         'expected to be greater than or equal to $7.0 billion . The '
         'preliminary outlook for 2019 assumes the U.S. Government continues '
         "to support and fund the corporation's key programs. Changes in "
         'circumstances may require the corporation to revise its assumptions, '
         'which could materially change its current estimate of 2019 net '
         'sales, operating margin and cash flows. The corporation expects the '
         'net 2019 FAS/CAS pension benefit to be approximately $1.5 billion '
         'assuming a 4.125 percent discount rate (a 50\xa0basis point increase '
         'from the end of 2017), a 1.00 percent return on plan assets in 2018, '
         'and a 7.00 percent expected long-term rate of return on plan assets '
         'in future years (a 50\xa0basis point decrease from the end of 2017), '
         'among other assumptions. As a result of the $5.0 billion in '
         'contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018 '
         'the corporation does not expect to make contributions to its '
         'qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. A change of plus or '
         'minus 25 basis points to the assumed discount rate, with all other '
         'assumptions held constant, would result in an incremental increase '
         'or decrease of approximately $120 million to the estimated net 2019 '
         'FAS/CAS pension adjustment. A change of plus or minus 100 basis '
         'points to the return on plan assets in 2018 only, with all other '
         'assumptions held constant, would increase or decrease the net 2019 '
         'FAS/CAS pension adjustment by approximately $20 million . The '
         'corporation will finalize the postretirement benefit plan '
         'assumptions and determine the 2018 actual return on plan assets on '
         'Dec. 31, 2018 . The final assumptions and actual investment return '
         'for 2018 may differ materially from those discussed above. Cash '
         "Activities The corporation's cash activities in the third quarter of "
         '2018 consisted of the following: As previously reported on Sept. 27, '
         '2018 , the corporation increased its quarterly dividend by $0.20 per '
         'share, to $2.20 per share, beginning with the dividend payment in '
         'the fourth quarter of 2018. The corporation also increased its share '
         'repurchase authority by $1.0 billion with $3.7 billion in total '
         'remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under '
         'the program as of Sept. 30, 2018 . Segment Results The corporation '
         'operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of '
         'products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire '
         'Control (MFC), RMS and Space. During the third quarter of 2018 the '
         'corporation realigned certain programs among the lines of business '
         'at MFC. The amounts discussed and presented for the MFC lines of '
         'business results reflect this realignment for all periods presented. '
         'The following table presents summary operating results of the '

         'business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are '
         'eliminated in consolidation. Operating profit of the business '
         "segments includes the corporation's share of earnings or losses from "
         'equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity '
         'method investees are closely aligned with the operations of the '
         "corporation's business segments. In addition, operating profit of "
         "the corporation's business segments includes total pension costs "
         'recoverable on U.S. Government contracts as determined in accordance '
         'with CAS. Operating profit of the business segments excludes the '
         'FAS/CAS operating adjustment, which represents the difference '
         'between the service cost component of pension expense recorded in '
         'accordance with FAS and CAS pension cost; the adjustment from CAS to '
         'the FAS service cost component for all other postretirement benefit '
         'plans; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items '
         "not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating "
         'performance, such as charges related to significant severance '
         'actions and certain asset impairments; gains or losses from '
         'significant divestitures; the effects of certain legal settlements; '
         "corporate costs not allocated to the corporation's business "
         'segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Changes in '
         'net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of '
         'volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales '
         'or operating profit resulting from varying production activity or '
         'service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment '
         'operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking '
         'rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of the '
         "corporation's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin "
         'may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit '
         "booking rates on the corporation's contracts for which it recognizes "
         'revenue over a period of time using the percentage-of-completion '
         'cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. '
         'Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk '
         'retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total '
         'costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved '
         'conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a '
         'particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the '
         'estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a '
         'reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in '
         'profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and '
         'reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment '
         'operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or '
         'unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. '
         'Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual '
         'matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, '

         'aircraft requiring heavy-lift/oversized cargo capability into and '
         'out of unconventional airports and remote locations for a specific '

         'LM‑100Js out of Fort Worth Alliance Airport in Texas . In '
         'conjunction with this announcement, an LM-100J aircraft will be on '
         'static display at the Alliance Air Show in Fort Worth , Oct. 13-14 . '
         '"In choosing the LM-100J, we have access to one of the newest cargo '
         'freighters that happens to have one of the most proven pedigrees in '
         'aviation: the C-130J Super Hercules. The LM-100J offers an '
         'outstanding performance record, reliability, experience and '
         'unmatched capabilities," said Emory Ellis , Pallas Aviation '
         'president. "There are other cargo aircraft in the market, but '
         "there's one LM-100J, and that's the airplane we need to do our "
         'job." Lockheed Martin introduced the LM-100J freighter in 2014 as an '
         'updated version of the L-100 legacy Hercules commercial variant. '
         'Lockheed Martin delivered more than 100 L-100s to private and '
         'government operators from 1964-1992. The LM-100J offers a '
         'civil-certified option for operators that builds on the proven '
         'performance of the military C-130J variants, which have flown almost '
         '2 million hours in support of a multitude of mission requirements. '
         '"Over the past few years, we\'ve had the honor to partner with the '
         'Pallas team in building the LM-100J and are excited to see this '
         'joint vision be a reality that we can share with the aviation '
         'industry," said George Shultz , vice president and general manager, '
         'Air Mobility & Maritime Missions at Lockheed Martin. "We can\'t wait '
         'for Pallas to show the world the versatility and capability that is '
         'found only in an LM-100J." Two LM-100Js are currently flying in '
         'support of FAA type certificate update testing. The C-130J was fully '
         'FAA certified when it was first developed and the LM-100J requires '
         'an update of this certificate. For more information on the LM-100J, '

         "the U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared "
         '(Next Gen OPIR) Geosynchronous (GEO) Block 0 missile warning '

         "Phase 1 contract for the Air Force's Next Gen OPIR Block 0 GEO "
         'satellites. The competition includes development scope through the '
         'Critical Design Review (CDR) phase. As part of a program heralded by '
         'the Air Force as a pacesetter for " Go Fast " acquisition, Lockheed '
         'Martin selected the two suppliers on September 28 -- just 45 days '
         "after the company's own prime contractor award. The Air Force "
         'awarded Lockheed Martin the contract for rapid development of the '
         'Next Gen OPIR Block 0 GEO system on August 14 . The Raytheon and '
         'Northrop Grumman/Ball Aerospace teams were selected due to their '
         'ability to meet stringent schedule and capability requirements. They '
         'are now tasked to develop detailed designs and compete their '
         'solutions for potential use on the Next Gen OPIR Block 0 GEO '
         'satellites. A final down-select is expected at the end of the CDR '
         'phase in 2020. Next Gen OPIR is a new missile warning satellite '
         'system acquisition program that will deliver advanced capabilities '
         'to keep pace with adversary advancements. It will succeed the Space '
         'Based Infrared System by providing improved missile warning '
         'capabilities that are more survivable and resilient against emerging '
         'threats. The Air Force implemented Next Gen OPIR as a rapid '
         'acquisition program with Lockheed Martin targeting the first GEO '
         'satellite delivery in 60 months. "Next Gen OPIR is a very important '
         'program for our nation, with a challenging schedule, and set of '
         'technical and resiliency requirements, different than prior '
         'programs," said Tom McCormick , Lockheed Martin\'s vice president '
         'for OPIR systems. "We recognize that this is a watershed program for '
         "the Air Force, and we understand the need to 'Go Fast' to ensure our "
         'national security posture stays ahead of emerging global threats." '
         'Lockheed Martin is working with the Air Force on a variety of '
         'initiatives to increase the speed of satellite acquisition, '
         'including introducing more commonality of parts and procedures into '

         'for human deep space missions that will take astronauts farther into '
         'space than they have ever gone before. The company is asking for '
         'both domestic and international organizations to provide ideas of '
         "commercial payloads that would fly on one of Orion's upcoming "
         'missions to the Moon and back. The payloads could be for science, '
         'STEM, art and entertainment, data or any other commercial endeavor. '
         'Payloads can be flown in the interior crew cabin or mounted to the '
         'exterior and can be static or deployable. Lockheed Martin is working '
         'with NanoRacks to perform the study. NanoRacks is the leading '
         'provider of commercial access to the International Space Station, '
         'with services including safety, launch manifesting, payload '
         'integration, logistics and astronaut crew operations. The company '
         'has brought more than 700 payloads to the space station. "Access to '
         'the Moon and deep space for commercial entities opens up new worlds '
         'for all of us. It advances science, powers innovation, and inspires '
         'a new generation of engineers," said Mike Hawes , Orion program '
         'manager and vice president of Human Space Exploration, Commercial '
         'Civil Space at Lockheed Martin Space. "We\'ve seen that model work '
         'on the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit, and now, '
         "working with NanoRacks, we're applying that same successful model to "
         'deep space." Building on a proven and robust infrastructure in '
         'Orion, commercial access to deep space could be offered at a '
         'reasonable price and with a high degree of confidence in success. '
         '"At NanoRacks, we pride ourselves on knowing exactly what our '
         'commercial customer needs are for a growing number of in-space '
         'platforms and knowing how to deliver efficient services at a '
         'competitive price. That is why we see this effort with Lockheed '
         'Martin as a win-win," said Jeffrey Manber , CEO and Co-Founder of '
         'NanoRacks. "Lockheed Martin brings unmatched capabilities in '
         'engineering, mission management, and deep space vehicle design. '
         'NanoRacks delivers a strong understanding of the market and an '
         'ability to match the needs of customers with a technical solution. '
         'Working together, we believe we can prepare for future missions by '
         'creating unprecedented opportunities and building a solid foundation '
         'for commercial opportunities at the Moon and, one day, beyond." '
         'Commercial payloads on Orion are a natural starting point for future '
         'expansion into areas like the lunar Gateway , landers, and even Mars '
         'spacecraft. By starting with Orion, industry could work with NASA '
         'and the international community to standardize the interfaces '
         'between national exploration ships and commercial payloads. Doing so '
         'will make it much easier to plug into future exploration platforms '
         'and give commercial providers a predictable and simplified design '
         'and engineering framework. Although NASA is aware of the market '
         'assessment there is no current agreement or commitment with NASA on '
         'how this would be implemented. To submit an idea for a commercial '

 'text': 'Moorestown , N.J., Oct. 16, 2018 – Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE: LMT) '
         'Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) has completed a closed loop '
         'satellite track with tactical hardware and software marking a '
         'significant achievement as the program continues to meet its '
         'technical milestones and works towards delivery to the Missile '
         'Defense Agency (MDA) in 2020 at its Clear, Alaska, site. In '
         'preparation for full-rate manufacturing starting in the beginning of '
         '2019, Lockheed Martin utilized production hardware, tactical backend '
         'processing equipment along with tactical software to successfully '
         'demonstrate system performance in an operational environment.\xa0 A '
         'series of tests were performed in this environment including a '
         'closed loop satellite track demonstrating significant maturity of '
         'the program. As a risk mitigation effort in achieving delivery to '
         'MDA in 2020, Lockheed Martin invested in a Solid State Radar '
         'Integration Site (SSRIS) in Moorestown, New Jersey, which was '
         'utilized to conduct this testing.\xa0 The SSRIS is a scaled version '
         'of the final LRDR radar and will continue to be utilized for Solid '
         'State Radar (SSR) development. “I am extremely proud of what the '
         'team has accomplished since the award in 2015,” said Chandra '
         'Marshall, LRDR program director, Lockheed Martin, “We have designed '
         'and produced a scaled LRDR system that is running with the actual '
         'tactical processing equipment and tactical software '
         'successfully.\xa0 Demonstrations executed to date prove that '
         'Lockheed Martin has designed a solid state radar system that is on '
         'schedule to deliver on time and is on track to achieve its mission '
         'to defend the homeland.” The SSR concept uses a scalable, modular '
         'and extensible Gallium Nitride (GaN) based radar building block, '
         'which in addition to cutting edge performance provides increased '
         'efficiency and reliability to achieve the homeland defense mission '
         'and pace ever-evolving threats. LRDR completed its critical design '
         'review in 2017 and in September began construction of the radar in '
         'Alaska. “Since the contract was awarded in 2015, the LRDR team has '
         'been moving fast and keeping a steady pace achieving every milestone '
         'successfully on the path to delivery in 2020,” according to '
         'Marshall. The radar system will serve as a critical sensor within '
         'MDA’s layered defense strategy to protect the U.S. homeland from '
         'ballistic missile attack. LRDR will provide 24/7/365 acquisition, '
         'tracking and discrimination data to enable defense systems to lock '
         'on and engage ballistic missile threats. LRDR adds the capability of '
         'discriminating threats at extended distances using the inherent '
         'wideband capability of the hardware coupled with advanced software '
         'algorithms. LRDR combines proven SSR technologies with proven '
         'ballistic missile defense algorithms, all based upon an open '
         'architecture platform capable of meeting future growth. Lockheed '
         'Martin sees SSR as the cornerstone of its current and future radar '
         'development and is key in its development of LRDR. The program is '
         'built upon the U.S. government’s long-term investment in S-Band '
         'radar, ground-based radar, and systems integration, as evident in '
         'such Lockheed Martin technologies as the Aegis Combat System, Space '
         'Fence and Aegis Ashore.\xa0 Earlier this year, Lockheed Martin '
         'demonstrated its commitment to advancing SSR technology and '
         'addressing emerging and evolving threats by connecting key '
         'components of LRDR and its Aegis Ashore technologies, demonstrating '
         'the ability to greatly increase operational performance, efficiency '
         'and reliability of Aegis Ashore. Connecting these systems also '
         'provides the warfighter with earlier intelligence and expanded '

         'Sikorsky S-97 Raider light tactical prototype helicopter is '
         'advancing rapidly through its flight test schedule, recently '
         'exceeding 200 knots at the Sikorsky Development Flight Center. '
         'Raider, developed by Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) '
         "company, is based on the company's proven X2 Technology , enabling "
         'speeds twice that of conventional helicopters. View the latest '
         'Sikorsky S-97 Raider video. "The Sikorsky S-97 Raider flight test '
         "program is exceeding expectations, demonstrating Raider's "
         'revolutionary speed, maneuverability and agility," said Tim Malia , '
         'Sikorsky director, Future Vertical Lift Light. "X2 Technology '
         'represents a suite of technologies needed for the future fight, '
         'enabling the warfighter to engage in high-intensity conflict '
         'anytime, anywhere as a member of a complex, multi-domain team." '
         'Sikorsky continues to demonstrate the application of its X2 '
         "Technology as the company prepares its proposal for the U.S. Army's "
         'Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) competition, driving '
         "forward the Army's efforts to revolutionize its aircraft fleet as "
         'part of what is known as Future Vertical Lift. Raider incorporates '
         'the latest advances in fly-by-wire flight controls, vehicle '
         'management systems and systems integration. The suite of X2 '
         'Technologies enables the aircraft to operate at high speeds while '
         'maintaining the low-speed handling qualities and maneuverability of '
         'conventional single main rotor helicopters. "It\'s exciting to '
         'achieve these high speeds with X2 Technology," said Sikorsky '
         'experimental test pilot Bill Fell , a retired U.S. Army pilot. '
         '"It\'s undeniably important for the warfighter to get to the mission '
         'fast. And once they get there, X2 Technology provides the critical '
         'handling qualities that make the aircraft survivable, lethal and '
         'agile. Sikorsky X2 Technology changes the way we fly and fight – we '
         'can get there fast, be more effective while on the scene and we can '
         'get out fast." Sikorsky\'s X2 Technology at the heart of the Raider '
         'helicopter is scalable to a variety of military missions including '
         'light assault, light attack, armed reconnaissance, close-air '
         'support, combat search and rescue and unmanned applications. The '

 'text': 'DENVER , Oct. 1, 2018 / PRNewswire / --\xa0Today, 3-D printing '
         'generates parts used in ships, planes, vehicles and spacecraft, but '
         'it also requires a lot of babysitting. High-value and intricate '
         'parts sometimes require constant monitoring by expert specialists to '
         'get them right. Furthermore, if any one section of a part is below '
         "par, it can render the whole part unusable. That's why Lockheed "
         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) and the Office of Naval Research are exploring '
         'how to apply artificial intelligence to train robots to '
         'independently oversee—and optimize—3-D printing of complex parts. '
         'The two-year, $5.8 million contract specifically studies and will '
         'customize multi-axis robots that use laser beams to deposit '
         "material. The team led by Lockheed Martin's Advanced Technology "
         'Center will develop software models and sensor modifications for the '
         'robots to build better components. "We will research ways machines '
         'can observe, learn and make decisions by themselves to make better '
         'parts that are more consistent, which is crucial as 3-D printed '
         'parts become more and more common," said Brian Griffith , Lockheed '
         'Martin\'s project manager. "Machines should monitor and make '
         'adjustments on their own during printing to ensure that they create '
         'the right material properties during production." Researchers will '
         'apply machine learning techniques to additive manufacturing so '
         'variables can be monitored and controlled by the robot during '
         'fabrication. "When you can trust a robotic system to make a quality '
         'part, that opens the door to who can build usable parts and where '
         'you build them," said Zach Loftus , Lockheed Martin Fellow for '
         'additive manufacturing. "Think about sustainment and how a '
         'maintainer can print a replacement part at sea, or a mechanic print '
         'a replacement part for a truck deep in the desert. This takes 3-D '
         'printing to the next, big step of deployment." Currently, '
         'technicians spend many hours per build testing quality after '
         "fabrication, but that's not the only waste in developing a complex "
         "part. It's common practice to build each part compensating for the "
         'weakest section for a part and allowing more margin and mass in the '
         "rest of the structure. Lockheed Martin's research will help machines "
         'make decisions about how to optimize structures based on previously '
         'verified analysis. That verified analysis and integration into a 3-D '
         'printing robotic system is core to this new contract. Lockheed '
         'Martin, along with its strong team, will vet common types of '
         'microstructures used in an additive build. Although invisible from '
         'the outside, a part could have slightly different microstructures on '
         'the inside. The team will measure the performance attributes of the '
         'machine parameters, these microstructures and align them to material '
         'properties before integrating this knowledge into a working system. '
         'With this complete set of information, machines will be able to make '
         'decisions about how to print a part that ensures good performance. '
         'The team is starting with the most common titanium alloy, Ti-6AI-4V, '
         'and integrating the related research with seven industry, national '
         'lab and university partners. About Lockheed Martin Headquartered in '

         'International Astronautical Congress ( IAC ) in Bremen, Germany , '
         "Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) experts revealed the company's crewed "
         'lunar lander concept and showed how the reusable lander aligns with '
         "NASA's lunar Gateway and future Mars missions. Concept video: "
         'https://vimeo.com/293133933 The crewed lunar lander is a single '
         'stage, fully reusable system that incorporates flight-proven '
         "technologies and systems from NASA's Orion spacecraft . In its "
         'initial configuration, the lander would accommodate a crew of four '
         'and 2,000 lbs. of cargo payload on the surface for up to two weeks '
         'before returning to the Gateway without refueling on the surface. '
         '"NASA asked industry for innovative and new approaches to advance '
         "America's goal of returning humans to the Moon, and establishing a "
         'sustainable, enduring presence there," said Lisa Callahan , vice '
         'president and general manager of Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed '
         'Martin Space. "This is a concept that takes full advantage of both '
         'the Gateway and existing technologies to create a versatile, '
         'powerful lander that can be built quickly and affordably. This '
         'lander could be used to establish a surface base, deliver scientific '
         'or commercial cargo, and conduct extraordinary exploration of the '
         'Moon." The unique orbit of the lunar Gateway provides global lunar '
         'access for a lander. Having the ability to visit multiple sites with '
         'a reusable lander supports many international, commercial, and '
         "scientific communities, in addition to NASA's sustainable "
         'exploration of the Moon. After a surface mission, it would return to '
         'the Gateway, where it can be refueled, serviced, and then kept in '
         'orbit until the next surface sortie mission. "The Gateway is key to '
         'full, frequent and fast reusability of this lander," said Tim Cichan '
         ', space exploration architect at Lockheed Martin Space, who '
         'presented the lander concept at IAC. "Because this lander doesn\'t '
         "have to endure the punishment of re-entering Earth's atmosphere, it "
         'can be re-flown many times over without needing significant and '
         "costly refurbishment. That's a major advantage of the Gateway and of "
         'a modular, flexible, reusable approach to deep space exploration." '
         'The investments made in technology developed for Orion can be '
         're-used to reduce the cost, complexity and development timeline. '
         'Some of the human-rated, flight-proven systems used in the design '
         'include avionics, life support, communications and navigation '
         'systems, and a light-weight version of its crew module pressure '
         'vessel. Reusable landers are enabled by the lunar Gateway and are '
         'important for sustainable exploration. Additionally, landed human '
         'lunar missions and a lunar orbiting outpost are valuable to prepare '
         "for sending humans to Mars. While the Moon doesn't have an "
         'atmosphere, there are still many lessons that apply to a future '
         'crewed Mars lander, such as: operations experience in a challenging '
         'and dynamic environment, operating and refueling out of orbit, '
         'long-duration cryogenic propulsion, and terminal descent navigation, '

         'Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) have finalized '
         'an $11.5 billion contract for the production and delivery of 141 '
         'F-35 aircraft at the lowest per aircraft price in program history. '
         'For the eleventh consecutive year, the cost of an F-35A was '
         'lowered.\xa0 The F-35A unit price including aircraft, engine and '
         'fee, is $89.2 million . This represents a 5.4 percent reduction from '
         'the $94.3 million it cost for an F-35A in Low-Rate Initial '
         'Production Lot 10 (LRIP 10). In LRIP 11, the F-35B unit cost was '
         'lowered to $115.5 million .\xa0 This represents a 5.7 percent '
         'reduction from the $122.4 million it cost for the short-takeoff and '
         'landing variant in LRIP 10.\xa0The F-35C unit cost was lowered to '
         '$107.7 million .\xa0This represents an 11.1 percent reduction from '
         'the $121.2 million it cost for the carrier variant in LRIP 10.\xa0'
         'The LRIP 11 agreement funds 91 aircraft for the U.S. Services, 28 '
         'for F-35 International Partners and 22 for F-35 Foreign Military '
         'Sales customers. Deliveries will begin in 2019. "Driving down cost '
         'is critical to the success of this program," said Vice Admiral Mat '
         'Winter, F-35 Program Executive Officer.\xa0"We are delivering on our '
         'commitment to get the best price for taxpayers and warfighters. '
         '"This agreement for the next lot of F-35s represents a fair deal for '
         'the U.S. Government, our international partnership and industry.\xa0 '
         'We remain focused on aggressively reducing F-35 cost and delivering '
         'best value." With stealth technology, supersonic speed, powerful '
         'sensors, large weapons capacity and global deployment, the F-35 is '
         'the most advanced fighter aircraft ever built, enabling women and '
         'men in uniform to execute their mission and return home safely. More '
         "than a fighter jet, the F-35's ability to collect, analyze and share "
         'data, is a powerful force multiplier that enhances all airborne, '
         'surface and ground-based assets in the battlespace. "This agreement '
         'marks a significant step forward for the F-35 program as we continue '
         'to increase production, reduce costs and deliver transformational '
         'capabilities to our men and women in uniform," said Greg Ulmer , '
         'F-35 Vice President and General Manager. "As production ramps up, '
         'and we implement additional cost savings initiatives, we are on '
         'track to reduce the cost of the F-35A to $80 million by 2020, which '
         'is equal to or less than legacy aircraft, while providing a major '
         'leap in capability." Program Progress The latest contract is a '
         "demonstration of the program's progress and maturity, as industry "
         'and the government now set their sights on future acquisition '
         'approaches for the next three production lots to further reduce '
         'costs. With more than 320 aircraft operating from 15 bases around '
         "the globe – the F-35 is playing a critical role in today's global "
         'security environment. More than 680 pilots and 6,200 maintainers '
         'have been trained and the F-35 fleet has surpassed more than 155,000 '
         'cumulative flight hours. The F-35 weapons system reliability '
         'continues to improve through a combination of hardware and software '
         'improvements. In addition to advanced capability, the F-35 provides '
         'economic stability to the U.S. and Allied nations by creating jobs, '
         'commerce and security, and contributing to the global trade balance. '
         'The F-35 is built by thousands of men and women in America and '

 'text': 'FORT WORTH, Texas , Sept. 27, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE: LMT) has selected Harris Corporation (NYSE: HRS) to develop '
         'and deliver the next generation Integrated Core Processor (ICP) for '
         'the F-35 fighter jet. The Lockheed Martin-led competition within the '
         'F-35 supply chain will significantly reduce cost and enhance '
         "capability. The F-35's ICP acts as the brains of the F-35, "
         "processing data for the aircraft's communications, sensors, "
         'electronic warfare, guidance and control, cockpit and helmet '
         'displays. "We are aggressively pursuing cost reduction across the '
         'F-35 enterprise and, after conducting a thorough review and robust '
         "competition, we're confident the next generation Integrated Core "
         'Processor will reduce costs and deliver transformational '
         'capabilities for the warfighter," said Greg Ulmer , Lockheed Martin '
         'vice president and general manager of the F-35 program. "The next '
         'generation Integrated Core Processor for the F-35 will have positive '
         'benefits for all customers in terms of life cycle cost, capability, '
         'reliability and more." The new Integrated Core Processor is a key '
         'element of the planned "Technology Refresh 3" modernization that '
         'takes advantage of fast evolving computing power to ensure the '
         'advanced F-35 remains ahead of evolving threats. Additional elements '
         'in the tech refresh include the Panoramic Cockpit Display Electronic '
         'Unit and Aircraft Memory System, which were also recompeted and '
         'awarded to Harris last year. Reduce Costs, Increased Performance The '
         'Harris -built ICP will be integrated into F-35 aircraft starting '
         'with Lot 15 aircraft, expected to begin deliveries in 2023. The next '
         'generation ICP system is targeted to generate the following results '
         'compared to the current system: "The new F-35 ICP will pave the way '
         'for system scalability well into the future," said Ed Zoiss , '
         'president, Harris Electronic Systems. "Open systems are the future '
         'of avionics and Harris has invested substantial R&D to deliver more '
         'affordable and\xa0higher performance solutions than would have been '
         'possible using proprietary technology." Supply Chain Optimization '
         "The ICP selection comes on the heels of Lockheed Martin's selection "
         'of Raytheon for the Next Gen Distributed Aperture System, which will '
         'reduce lifecycle costs by more than $3 billion , enhance reliability '
         'and increased capability. "With production ramping up and the '
         'operational fleet growing fast, we are looking at every layer of our '
         'global supply chain to find opportunities to increase capacity, '
         'reduce production and sustainment costs, improve parts reliability '
         'and enhance capabilities," said Ulmer. In addition to competition, '
         'the company is transitioning several F-35 suppliers to longer term '
         'Performance Based Logistics contracts to enhance parts availability '
         'and reduce sustainment costs. Previously under annual contracts, the '
         'new 5-year PBLs allow each supplier to make longer term investments '
         'and actions to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. With radar '
         'evading stealth technology, advanced sensors, enhanced weapons '
         'capacity, supersonic speed and superior range, the F-35 is the most '

         'GaN foundry model leveraging relationships with commercial suppliers '
         'that utilize the power of the expansive telecommunications market. '
         'This process eliminates the cost of foundry operations, takes '
         'advantage of the telecommunications industry’s investment in GaN, '
         'enables competition and ultimately reduces costs. The primary '
         'mission of the multi-mission Q-53 is to protect troops in combat by '
         'detecting, classifying, tracking and identifying the location of '
         'enemy indirect fire in either 360 or 90-degree modes. Mounted on a '
         'five-ton truck, the Q-53 can be rapidly deployed, automatically '
         'leveled then operated remotely or from a command vehicle with a '
         'laptop computer. The radar is software defined allowing for quick '
         'adjustment to address emerging Army capability needs for air '
         'surveillance and counter fire target acquisition. The Q-53 has '
         'protected warfighters around the world since 2010. Lockheed Martin '
         'currently produces multiple Q-53 radars annually. Work on the system '
         'is performed at Lockheed Martin facilities in New York, New Jersey '
         'and Florida. For more information visit '

         'will train the full aircrew, allowing pilots and special mission '

         'Sikorsky. "The combat rescue mission is uniquely challenging in that '
         'it requires much of the mission planning to occur while in flight '

         'condition of isolated personnel to be rescued are not fully known '
         'prior to takeoff.\xa0This requires that the aircrew become highly '
         'skilled at using the enormous networking and information '
         'capabilities that reside within the HH-60W, and that takes training '
         'and practice.\xa0These Weapons Systems and Operational Flight '
         'trainers will allow that training at the highest fidelity and '

         'is poised to continue to support military and search and rescue '
         'efforts around the world for decades to come with ongoing technology '
         'enhancements. Sikorsky launched the #MyBlackHawkStory social media '
         'campaign and is encouraging anyone with a story to share about this '
         'aircraft, to do so through Twitter and Instagram, or the Lockheed '
         'Martin website . Following the campaign, which runs through October, '
         'Sikorsky will donate $5,000 to Operation Homefront , a nonprofit '
         'organization that assists military families during difficult '
         'financial times. Sikorsky will conclude the 40 th anniversary '
         'celebrations on Oct. 31, which marks the date of the first Black '
         'Hawk delivery to the U.S. Army in 1978. Black Hawk By the Numbers '
         'During the last 40 years, brave crews have flown the Black Hawk in '
         'and out of countless combat and disaster zones to deliver and '
         'extract troops, save lives in casualty evacuation missions, provide '
         'critical supplies to troops, deliver emergency supplies during '
         'natural disasters, and perform as aerial firefighters and border '
         'patrollers. “Sikorsky is the company it is today because of the '
         'Black Hawk,” said Sikorsky President Dan Schultz. “This iconic '
         'aircraft continues to deliver on critical missions when reliability '
         'and performance are nonnegotiable. Sikorsky is proud to recognize '
         'the Black Hawk’s 40 th anniversary and the men and women who serve '
         'with and are supported by this aircraft around the world every day.” '
         '“We are committed to the U.S. Army – and all other H-60 operators – '
         'and look forward to continued partnerships on the Black Hawk program '
         'in the years to come,” added Dana Fiatarone, Vice President, Army '
         'and Air Force Systems, Sikorsky. “It is our priority to continue '
         'fulfilling current and future requirements in order to meet the '
         'needs of operational units both today and tomorrow.” The Future of '
         'the Black Hawk Sikorsky continues to build H-60M Black Hawk aircraft '
         'for the U.S. Army, which is expected to operate the platform into '
         'the 2070s. The company continues to modify the Black Hawk to meet '
         'the mission requirements of its customers and has produced several '
         'successful H-60 variants. The MH-60R Seahawk is an UH-60-based '
         'maritime variant in operation and deployed by the U.S. Navy, as well '
         'as numerous international military customers. Its primary missions '
         'are anti-submarine warfare and surface warfare, while secondary '
         'missions include search and rescue, vertical replenishment, naval '
         'surface fire support, logistics support, communications relay, '
         'personnel transport, and medical evacuation. Additionally, the U.S. '
         'Air Force currently operates the HH-60G Pavehawk combat rescue '
         'helicopter. In February of this year, Sikorsky began the final '
         'assembly process of the first HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH) '
         'to replace this long-serving variant. The “Whiskey” model, which is '
         'expected to take its first flight by year-end, is based on the '
         'proven technology of the latest Black Hawk model, the UH-60M, an '
         'enhanced version of the former UH-60L model. Sikorsky continues to '
         'field new mission capabilities for the Black Hawk: Sikorsky also is '
         'developing an optionally piloted capability utilizing its MATRIX™ '
         'Technology with the intelligence and autonomy to carry out missions '
         'with two, one or zero crew members on board. This technology is '
         'flying on the company’s commercial S-76® helicopter, the Sikorsky '
         'Autonomy Research Aircraft (SARA). Sikorsky expects first flight of '
         'the optionally piloted Black Hawk in 2018. Fiatarone concluded, '
         '“Sikorsky continues to position the Black Hawk platform for future '
         'growth with technological advancements to improve overall '
         'reliability, survivability, lift capability, and availability of '
         'aircraft, enabling soldiers to successfully and safely complete '
         'their missions…and more importantly, return home, every time.” For '

 'text': 'ADELAIDE, Australia, Sept. 5, 2018 - A 12-month research partnership '
         'between Lockheed Martin Australia and Deakin University’s Institute '
         'for Intelligent Systems Research (IISRI) has extended the capability '
         'of Lockheed Martin’s FORTIS Exoskeleton. The FORTIS is an unpowered, '
         'lightweight exoskeleton designed by Lockheed Martin that makes tools '
         'weighing up to 36 pounds feel weightless - reducing user fatigue and '
         'improving worker safety. Using motion capture obtained from sensors '
         'on the arms and shoulders of exoskeleton operators and analyzed by '
         'signal processing techniques, the IISRI team used biomechanics to '
         'test the ergonomic effects of using power tools on the human body. '
         'Deakin IISRI researchers also designed and 3D-printed new '
         'attachments to expand the functionality of the FORTIS Exoskeleton, '
         'allowing it to accommodate external loads usually mounted on the '
         'back of the human body. Speaking at Land Forces 2018 in Adelaide, '
         'Lockheed Martin Australia’s Strategic Engagement Director Scott '
         'Thompson said the partnership had delivered tangible outcomes for '
         'industry and further reinforced the status of Australian researchers '
         'as world-class. “Lockheed Martin invests in partnerships with '
         'Australia’s research and industry communities to support our global '
         'supply chains, providing opportunities for technology transfer, '
         'innovation, local skilled jobs and sustainable business growth,” he '
         'said. “The innovative work done by Dr. Mohammed Hossny and his team '
         'at Deakin’s IISRI extends the technological foundation for the '
         'FORTIS Exoskeleton with the potential for a broad range of '
         'applications across the defense, automotive and mining industries.” '
         'James Heading, business development senior manager, Lockheed Martin '
         'Australia, commended the Deakin research team and outlined the '
         'inherent challenges associated with exoskeleton research. “Lockheed '
         'Martin has a proud history of successfully developing and '
         'demonstrating exoskeleton applications that take the work out of '
         'many demanding, repetitive tasks,” he said. “Originating from '
         'Lockheed Martin’s exoskeleton research to assist soldiers to carry '
         'heavy equipment over long distances, the same principles of how the '
         'body works and expends energy were applied to exoskeleton '
         'development for use in industrial settings. “The technology '
         'supporting the exoskeleton may look simple but developing '
         'technologies that are a help and not a hindrance is a deceptively '
         'difficult engineering task. No two people are the same, so the '
         'exoskeleton needs to be designed to adjust and fit any sized person '
         'and accommodate different anthropometry,” Heading concluded. Dr. '
         'Hossny, Senior Research Fellow, IISRI at Deakin University, '
         'commended the research project, led by Darius Nahavandi as part of '
         'his Ph.D. research, for identifying the importance of biomechanic '
         'analysis of assistive devices. “The project has accelerated the '
         'design-testing loop for designing and tuning exoskeletons,” he said. '
         '"There is often a trade-off to be considered when adopting assistive '
         'devices in theworkplace. While assistive devices help channel the '
         'load through the skeletal structure of the exoskeleton, our work '
         'optimizes the operator’s movement so they are able to cope with '
         'increased repetition and indirect loads during motions,” he '

 'text': 'NATIONAL HARBOR, Md, Sept. 17, 2018 — Success in future conflicts '
         'will require the ability to operate across a resilient network that '
         'connects disparate systems and assets across different domains. To '
         'move toward this future, Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] has introduced '
         'the Multi-Domain Synchronized Effects Tool (MDSET), which links '
         'traditionally stove-piped resources to create synergistic effects '
         'and shorten the “data to decision cycle.” “In planning missions, our '
         'troops need the agility to succeed amidst uncertainty,” said Dr. Rob '
         'Smith, vice president of C4ISR and Unmanned Aerial Systems. “MDSET '
         'provides that agility by removing centricity from operational '
         'planning and paving the way for true multi-domain mission effects '
         'planning and replanning at speed and at scale.” MDSET addresses the '
         'complexity of the multi-domain battle by transforming command and '
         'control into a collaborative cross domain decision-making framework '
         '. Assimilating essential information from stove-piped systems into '
         'one intuitive system, MDSET creates a comprehensive picture of the '
         'integrated plan, allowing decisions to be made based on concurrent '
         '(vs. serial) situational awareness of activity in all domains. To '
         'further the development of multi-domain enabled technologies, '
         'Lockheed Martin has hosted a series of wargames – most recently this '
         'past August – that explore the processes needed to support rapid and '
         'continuous operational planning. The MDSET system played a '
         'significant role at these wargames, where the system gave '

 'text': 'NATIONAL HARBOR, Md, Sept. 18, 2018 — Working with the Air Force, '
         'Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has used agile development to evolve the '
         'signals intelligence capabilities for the Distributed Common Ground '
         'System, the Air Force’s intelligence, surveillance and '
         'reconnaissance (ISR) system. The AF DCGS produces actionable '
         'intelligence from data collected by sensors on manned and unmanned '
         'ISR platforms. “To help our customers upgrade systems, Lockheed '
         'Martin is using modern agile methodologies, which unlike other '
         'software development approaches, welcome change,” said Dr. Rob '
         'Smith, Vice President of C4ISR and Unmanned Aerial Systems. “For '
         'DCGS, we worked with the Air Force to provide a spiral-based agile '
         'development and integration model leading to “continuous integration '
         '- continuous delivery.” Using this agile approach, Lockheed Martin '
         'helped the Air Force transform DCGS to a modern architecture capable '
         'of rapidly integrating new capabilities as threats evolve. '
         'Partnering with the AF DCGS requirements, acquisition, and security '
         'communities, Lockheed Martin was able to migrate the majority of '
         'DCGS signals intelligence applications onto the open architecture '
         'infrastructure for testing just 10 months after task order receipt. '
         'In the past, large system releases would begin testing event some 18 '
         'to 24 months after award. Lockheed Martin helped gain efficiencies '
         'in software development, reduce the software lifecycle time and '
         'field new capabilities quarterly, representing a 50-75 percent '
         'reduction in fielding timelines. The enhanced AF DCGS signals '
         'intelligence capabilities will allow airmen to be faster and more '
         'effective in executing the DCGS worldwide intelligence mission. This '
         'is also a critical step in the transforming DCGS from traditional '
         'sites to a worldwide hub-based architecture, which paves the way '
         'forward for centralized processing and remote support. This '
         'hub-based architectural tenet will lead to significant cost savings '
         'in support contracts and allow that savings to be reinvested into '
         'the development of new applications and capabilities for DCGS. This '
         'effort also demonstrates Lockheed Martin’s commitment to modern '
         'agile methodologies, to field capabilities that are modular, open, '
         'non-proprietary and aligned to customer desires for faster, more '
         'cost-effective development efforts. As Lockheed Martin and '
         'government learned agile together, as a team they streamlined '
         'processes and adapted and institutionalized new methodologies. This '
         'shift toward agile processes includes guiding principles such as '
         'value stream mapping and reduced testing through increased '
         'automation. For additional information, visit our website: Lockheed '

 'text': 'LOS ANGELES , Aug. 21, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- AECOM, a premier, '
         'fully integrated global infrastructure firm, announced today that it '
         'has begun construction of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) at '
         "Fort Carson, Colorado , using Lockheed Martin's (NYSE: LMT) GridStar "
         '® Lithium energy storage system. The 4.25 MW/8.5 MWh BESS is part of '
         'an energy savings performance contract (ESPC) project to reduce Fort '
         "Carson's energy costs and increase its energy resilience. Though "
         'there are some existing energy storage systems at military bases, '
         'this unit will be the largest stand-alone commercially contracted '
         'battery at an army base. The large, revenue-generating BESS operates '
         "behind Fort Carson's electric utility meter. It reduces electrical "
         'demand during peak intervals, thereby increasing power grid '
         'resilience. Because it was procured via ESPC, it required no capital '
         'expenditure by the Army. Implementation of this first-of-its-kind '
         "project will combine AECOM's development, integration and "
         "construction expertise with Lockheed Martin's modular, resilient "
         "GridStar ® energy storage units and Geli, Inc.'s predictive "
         'analytics control software. The BESS is intended to substantially '
         'reduce demand charges that Fort Carson pays to its electric '
         'provider. "During project development, our team surveyed the energy '
         'storage industry for the optimum solution for Fort Carson ," said '
         'Annika Moman , Senior Vice President, AECOM Power and Energy '
         'Services Lead. "We decided on Lockheed Martin\'s GridStar ® units '
         'due to their unique modular architecture allowing for a flexible '
         'design and a reduction in operational risk. Our working partnership '
         'with Lockheed and Geli was vital to our team and Fort Carson in '
         'making this ground-breaking project happen." Currently the primary '
         'use-case for the BESS is for demand charge reduction, but the BESS '
         'may assume additional missions, such as renewables optimization ( '
         'Fort Carson has large photovoltaic assets), frequency and voltage '
         "support for Fort Carson's distribution grid and, potentially, "
         'microgrid support. "Lockheed Martin is pleased to collaborate with '
         'AECOM to develop and implement the new military infrastructure that '
         'will help Fort Carson increase its resiliency and reduce their '
         'electricity costs," said John Battaglini , director with Lockheed '
         'Martin Energy. "The versatility of energy storage is a key enabler '
         "for the military's aggressive goals of achieving energy "
         'resiliency." Lockheed Martin\'s GridStar ® Lithium turnkey energy '
         'storage systems are Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 9540-certified, '
         'compact, easy to install, and scalable from 100 kW to multi-MW '
         'projects. GridStar ® Lithium is ideal for applications such as '
         'solar-plus-storage, demand charge reduction at commercial industrial '
         'and military facilities, and peak load management at utilities. '

         'for testing and operations. In 2016 and 2017, the Air Force placed '
         'Lockheed Martin under two contracts, called GPS III Contingency '
         'Operations (COps) and M-Code Early Use (MCEU), which directed the '
         'company to upgrade the existing Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP) '
         'Operational Control System (OCS), which operates today’s GPS '
         'constellation. These upgrades to the AEP OCS are intended to serve '
         'as gap fillers prior to the entire GPS constellation’s operational '
         'transition to the next generation Operational Control System (OCX) '
         'Block 1, now in development. In April 2018, the Air Force approved '
         'Lockheed Martin’s critical design for MCEU, essentially providing a '
         '“green light” for the company to proceed with software development '
         'and systems engineering to deploy the M-Code upgrade to the legacy '
         'AEP OCS. The Air Force gave a similar nod to COps in November 2016. '
         'COps is now on schedule for delivery in May 2019 and MCEU is '
         'scheduled for delivery in January 2020. “The Air Force declared the '
         'first GPS III satellite ‘Available for Launch’ last year, and it’s '
         'expected to launch later this year. Nine more GPS III satellites are '
         'following close behind in production flow,” explained Johnathon '
         'Caldwell, Lockheed Martin’s program manager for Navigation Systems. '
         '“GPS III is coming soon, and as these satellites are launched, COps '
         'and MCEU will allow the Air Force the opportunity to integrate these '
         'satellites into the constellation and to start testing some of GPS '
         'III’s advanced capabilities even earlier.” MCEU Capabilities: Part '
         'of the Air Force’s overall modernization plan for the GPS, M-Code is '
         'an advanced, new signal designed to improve anti-jamming and '
         'anti-spoofing, as well as to increase secure access to military\xa0'
         'GPS\xa0signals for U.S. and allied armed forces. To accelerate '
         'M-Code’s deployment to support testing and fielding of modernized '
         'user equipment in support of the warfighter, MCEU will upgrade the '
         'AEP OCS, allowing it to task, upload and monitor M-Code within the '
         'GPS constellation. MCEU will provide command and control of M-Code '
         'capability to eight GPS IIR-M and 12 GPS IIF satellites currently on '
         'orbit, as well as future GPS III satellites. COps Capabilities: '
         'Following launch and check out, each future GPS III satellite will '
         'take its place in the GPS constellation. The COps modifications will '
         'allow the AEP OCS to support these more powerful GPS III satellites, '
         'enabling them to perform their positioning, navigation and timing '
         'missions for more than one billion civil, commercial and military '
         'users who depend on GPS every day. Besides the addition of GPS III, '
         'COps will also continue to support all the GPS IIR, IIR-M and IIF '
         'satellites in the legacy constellation. Lockheed Martin has a long '
         'history of supporting ground systems, providing operations, '
         'sustainment and logistics support for nearly 60 Department of '
         'Defense satellites, including GPS, often allowing them to double '
         'their on-orbit operational design life. Lockheed Martin also is '
         'currently under contract to develop and build ten GPS III '
         'satellites, which will deliver three times better accuracy and '
         'provide up to eight times improved anti-jamming capabilities. GPS '
         "III's new L1C civil signal also will make it the first GPS satellite "
         'to be interoperable with other international global navigation '
         'satellite systems. For additional GPS III information, photos and '

         '(NYSE: LMT) delivered the 52nd C-5M Super Galaxy strategic transport '
         "modernized under the U.S. Air Force's Reliability Enhancement and "
         "Re-engining Program (RERP) on Aug. 2 at the company's Marietta, "
         'Georgia , facility. The delivery completes the RERP upgrade, which '
         'extends the service life of the C-5 fleet out until the 2040s. "With '
         'the capability inherent in the C-5M, the Super Galaxy is more '
         'efficient and more reliable, and better able to do its job of truly '
         'global strategic airlift," said Patricia Pagan , Lockheed Martin Air '
         'Mobility and Maritime Missions Strategic Airlift director, "I am '
         'very proud of the contractor-government team than carried out the '
         "C-5 fleet modernization effort. We've worked very hard to ensure the "
         'C-5Ms are the absolute best strategic airlifters possible for our '
         'armed forces." An Air Force Reserve Command aircrew from the 439th '
         'Airlift Wing at Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts , ferried '
         'the final C-5M to Stewart Air Force Base, New York , where the '
         'aircraft will undergo interior paint restoration. Once that work is '
         'complete, the aircraft will be flown to Westover where it will be '
         'the eighth C-5M assigned to the base. Lockheed Martin began RERP '
         'development work in 2001. RERP incorporates more than 70 '
         'improvements that improve reliability, efficiency, maintainability '
         'and availability. RERP included changes or modifications to the '
         'airframe structure; environmental and pneumatic systems; hydraulic '
         'systems, electrical system; fuel system; landing gear; and flight '
         'controls. The heart of the system is the GE F138 turbofan engine '
         '(known as a CF6-80C2L1F in the commercial world) de-rated to 50,000 '
         'pounds of thrust on the C-5M. This engine provides 22 percent more '
         'thrust than the out-of-production TF39 turbofans on the earlier '
         "C-5A/B/C aircraft. The engines also allow the C-5M to meet the FAA's "
         'Stage 4 noise reduction requirements. These changes, taken together, '
         'result in a 22 percent increase in thrust, a shorter takeoff roll; a '
         '58 percent improvement in climb rate; allows the C-5M to cruise—at '
         'maximum gross weight—in the Communication/Navigation/Surveillance / '
         'Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) flight environment; and greatly '
         'enhanced fuel efficiency and less tanker support demand. First '
         'flight of a modified aircraft to the C-5M standard came in Marietta, '
         'Georgia , on June 19, 2006 . The first operational C-5M was '
         'delivered to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware , on February 9, 2009 . '
         'A total of 49 C 5Bs, two C-5C aircraft, and one original C-5A was '
         'modified under RERP. The C-5M holds 89 FAI-certified world aviation '
         'records, the most by any aircraft type. These records include '
         'time-to-climb with payload, altitude with payload, and greatest '
         'payload carried. The C-5 Galaxy has been operated solely by the U.S. '
         'Air Force since 1970 and is the largest strategic airlifter in the '
         "U.S. Air Force's fleet. The C-5 is capable of carrying two 78-ton "
         'M1A1 main battle tanks or helicopters and other large equipment '
         'intercontinental distances. Fully loaded, a C-5 has a gross weight '
         'of more than 800,000 pounds. All of the C-5s were built at Lockheed '

 'text': 'HUNTSVILLE, Ala. , Aug. 6, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- The U.S. Army '
         'awarded Dynetics, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and its partners a $10 '
         'million contract to continue development for the next phase of the '
         'High Energy Laser Tactical Vehicle Demonstrator (HEL TVD) program, a '
         '100-kilowatt class laser weapon system. Laser weapons are ideally '
         'suited to address high volume, low cost threats because of their '
         'inexpensive cost per shot and deep magazine. Team Dynetics HEL TVD '
         'system incorporates highly reliable subsystems to withstand the '
         'expected rugged operation conditions. The team recently completed a '
         'System Requirements Review and technical baseline update. The next '
         'step in the program will be the preliminary design review in January '
         '2019 . "The HEL TVD program will be pivotal for the warfighters '
         'while they are protecting our country. Dynetics, Lockheed Martin and '
         'our partners are providing a safe and simple high energy laser '
         'weapon system that crews can operate for years to come and across '
         'various terrains," said Ronnie Chronister , Dynetics vice president '
         'of contracts. "We pulled together a cross-industry leading team, '
         'which has the expertise and knowledge to understand exactly what is '
         'needed. We believe that our solution will be straightforward and '
         'will be the type of system that will preferred by the Army." '
         'Dynetics is drawing on the experience of systems engineering, '
         'manufacturing, test and vehicle modifications for integration on the '
         'Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV). Lockheed Martin provides '
         'the laser subsystem, as well as other key subsystems. The spectral '
         'beam-combined fiber laser subsystem strongly leverages Lockheed '
         "Martin's experience from ground vehicle integration gained as part "
         'of the Army\'s Robust Electric Laser Initiative (RELI) program. "The '
         'proliferation of hostile unmanned aerial systems and rockets, '
         'artillery and mortars present an increasing threat to deployed U.S. '
         'troops. Laser weapons offer a deep magazine and very low cost per '
         'shot making them ideally suited to complement existing kinetic '
         'energy weapons to address intense UAS swarms and RAM raids," said '
         'Iain McKinnie , Lockheed Martin business development lead for '
         'Advanced Laser Solutions and Strategy. "The Army\'s HEL TVD program '
         'is a critical step toward realizing this potential, culminating in '
         '2022 testing of a mobile 100\xa0kW-class laser weapon system fully '
         'integrated with an Army FMTV truck." Lockheed Martin has more than '
         '40 years of experience developing laser weapon systems. The HEL TVD '
         'award leverages technology building blocks from internal research '
         'and development projects, including the ATHENA system and ALADIN '
         'laser, as well as contract experience gained from programs such as '
         "the U.S. Army's RELI program , the U.S. Air Force LANCE program and "
         'the U.S. Navy HELIOS and HEFL programs. Team Dynetics is one of two '
         'remaining contractors competing to build the demonstrator that will '
         'be tested in 2022. The winning contractor will be awarded a contract '
         'option to finish the design, build and integrate the laser weapon '
         'system onto an Army FMTV platform and conduct field testing at White '
         'Sands Missile Range in New Mexico . About Dynetics Dynetics provides '
         'responsive, cost-effective engineering, scientific and IT solutions '

         'declaring it technically sound and ready to launch. GPS III SV02 '
         'will bring new capabilities to U.S. and allied military forces, and '
         'a new civil signal that will improve future connectivity worldwide '
         'for commercial and civilian users. GPS III SV02 now awaits official '
         "call up for launch in Lockheed Martin's GPS III Processing Facility "
         'clean room in Denver . In June, the Air Force officially called up '
         'its first GPS III satellite for launch. "The first GPS III '
         "satellite, GPS III SV01, was declared 'Available for Launch' in "
         'September 2017 . It is now being prepared for shipment to Cape '
         'Canaveral, Florida for a launch before the end of the year,"\xa0said '

         'capabilities and more advanced technology." GPS III will be the most '
         'powerful GPS satellite ever on orbit. GPS III will have three times '
         'better accuracy and up to eight times improved anti-jamming '
         "capabilities. GPS III's new L1C civil signal also will make it the "
         'first GPS satellite to be interoperable with other international '
         'global navigation satellite systems. Lockheed Martin is now in full '
         'production on ten GPS III satellites at its GPS III Processing '
         'Facility near Denver . In June, GPS III SV03 completed Thermal '
         'Vacuum testing, strenuous environmental trials simulating operations '
         'in the harshest space environments. In May, the antenna deck was '
         'added to GPS III SV04, fully integrating it into a complete '
         'satellite ready to begin environmental testing. Right behind GPS III '
         'SV04 on the production line, the fifth, sixth and seventh GPS III '
         'satellites are in component build-up. The fifth satellite already '
         'has its navigation payload and is expected to be fully assembled '
         'later this summer. To date, more than 90 percent of parts and '
         'materials for all 10 satellites under contract have been received. '
         'In April, the company submitted a proposal to the government to '
         'build up to 22 additional GPS III Follow On (GPS IIIF) satellites '
         'which would bring even further enhanced capabilities to the GPS '

         "the corporation's share of earnings or losses from equity method "
         'investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees '
         "are closely aligned with the operations of the corporation's "

         'accordance with FAS and CAS pension cost; the FAS non-service cost '
         'component for all postretirement benefit plans, which is recorded in '
         'other non-operating expense, net; expense for stock-based '

         'charges related to significant severance actions and certain asset '
         'impairments; gains or losses from significant divestitures; the '
         'effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated '
         "to the corporation's business segments; and other miscellaneous "
         'corporate activities. Changes in net sales and operating profit '
         'generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer '
         'to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting '
         'from varying production activity or service levels on individual '
         'contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically '
         'based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. '
         "In addition, comparability of the corporation's segment sales, "
         'operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or '
         "unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the corporation's "
         'contracts for which it recognizes revenue over a period of time '
         'using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure '
         'progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, '
         'typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to '
         'revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance '
         'obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular '
         'contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may '
         'deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs '
         'to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit '
         'booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are '
         'recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date '
         'effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also '
         'be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or '
         'may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive '
         'resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and '
         'restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of '
         'assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of '
         'contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant '
         'severance actions which are excluded from segment operating results; '
         'reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on '
         "sales of certain assets. The corporation's consolidated net "
         'adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate '
         'adjustments, represented approximately 32 percent of total segment '
         'operating profit in the second quarter of 2018, compared to '

         'compared to 28.8\xa0percent in the second quarter of 2017. The lower '
         'rate for the second quarter of 2018 is primarily due to the '

         'of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 '

         'employee equity awards, and the research and development tax credit. '
         "The rate for the second quarter of 2018 benefited from the Tax Act's "
         'deduction for foreign derived intangible income. The rate for the '

         'recruiting 400 new employees with expertise in the following areas: '
         'avionics technicians, milling machinist, low observable coaters, '

         'About 310 F-35s have been delivered to date, and the current program '
         'of record calls for more than 3,000 aircraft. The F-35 enterprise '
         'has significantly increased production volume year-over-year to meet '
         'demand. Lockheed Martin met its 2017 delivery target of 66 aircraft, '
         'representing more than a 40 percent increase from 2016. In 2018, the '
         'company is on track to deliver 91 aircraft and is preparing to '
         'increase production volume year-over-year to hit a rate of '
         'approximately 160 aircraft per year in 2023. As production volume '
         'increases and Lockheed Martin implements cost savings initiatives, '
         'the company has significantly reduced costs. In fact, F-35 unit '
         'costs have declined by more than 60 percent since the first '
         'production lot. The enterprise is on track to reduce the cost of an '
         'F-35A to $80 million by 2020, which is equal to or less than legacy '
         'fourth generation aircraft, while providing a transformational leap '
         'in capability. The F-35 is built by thousands of men and women in '
         'America and around the world. With more than 1,500 suppliers in 46 '

 'text': 'FARNBOROUGH, England , July 18, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- Sikorsky, a '
         'Lockheed Martin company (NYSE: LMT), today celebrated 35 years of '
         'partnership with the UK Maritime & Coastguard Agency (MCA) and '
         'honored recent heroic lifesaving efforts of the MCA. \xa0A '
         'recognition ceremony took place at the Farnborough International '
         'Airshow. The relationship between Sikorsky and the MCA dates back to '
         "1983 when the MCA, through Her Majesty's Coastguard, began operating "
         'the Sikorsky S-61 helicopter. The HM Coastguard fleet currently '
         'includes 12 Sikorsky S-92® aircraft operating from Newquay , '
         'Caernarfon, Sumburgh, Stornoway, Humberside and Inverness . Since '
         'April 2015 , the MCA has utilized its S-92 fleet to conduct 4,500 '
         'search and rescue missions. "Sikorsky is honored to be a part of the '
         "MCA's mission for the past 35 years and is proud that the S-92 plays "
         'such a critical role in providing a safe, efficient and reliable '
         'aircraft with which to save lives," said Lockheed Martin\'s Rotary '
         'and Mission Systems Executive Vice President Dale Bennett . "With '
         'Sikorsky a part of Lockheed Martin, our focus is to fully support '
         'all our commercial helicopter customers and their missions." "I am '
         'very proud of the partnership we have with Sikorsky which has '
         'developed over the last 35 years," said Damien Oliver , MCA Aviation '
         'Programme Director. "Sikorsky\'s aircraft offer the very best in '
         'search and rescue capabilities, without which our crews across the '
         'UK could not deliver a first-class search and rescue helicopter '
         'service, saving the lives of those in difficulty at sea, in coastal '
         'areas and inland throughout the UK." The ceremony included honoring '
         'recent lifesaving efforts by the HM Coastguard helicopter crew at '
         'Inverness . The Sikorsky Winged-S Rescue Award is bestowed upon '
         'those who perform a lifesaving rescue with a Sikorsky aircraft. In '
         'June 2018 , two boys were winched to safety by a four-person HM '
         'Coastguard crew operating an S-92 helicopter. The boys, ages 11 and '
         '14, were swimming in the ocean when the tide began to rise and they '
         'found themselves unable to swim back to shore. The boys were able to '
         'climb atop an offshore rock formation as the rising tide threatened '
         'to submerge the rocks. A concerned citizen spotted the boys and '
         'notified HM Coastguard. The Inverness -based crew responded within '
         'three minutes and winched the boys safely to the nearby beach. The '
         'Rescue Award is the 50 th presented to the MCA by Sikorsky. For more '

         'command and control capability. With the ever increasing threat of '

         'information exchanges between various NATO and national missile '

         'success, as well as our expertise in command and control, weapon '
         'system development and systems integration to achieve the Alliance '
         'goals,” said Dr. Rob Smith,\xa0vice president\xa0of C4ISR for '
         'Lockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems. “Lockheed Martin’s '

         'Defence System is a result of our focus on end user needs.\xa0We '
         'delivered a very complex C2 capability that is intuitive and '

         'partnership with Raytheon and other U..S companies and we look '
         'forward to delivering this capability with ThalesRaytheonSystems.” '
         'According to Eric Marceau, CEO of ThalesRaytheonSystems, “This '

         'Hercules and an updated version of the legacy L-100 commercial '
         'Hercules freighter. The LM-100J is flying at and on static display '
         "at this year's FIAS. C-130s — legacy Hercules, Super Hercules and "
         'L-100s — have flown millions of hours in support of missions for '
         'military and civilian operators around the world for more than 60 '
         'years, which includes supporting firefighting missions for more than '
         '40 years. The LM-100J FireHerc builds on this proven experience and '
         'offers advanced capabilities to support aerial firefighting '
         'requirements for decades to come. "With the presence of wildfires '
         'increasing on a global scale, there is a real-time need to provide '
         'more advanced assets to protect our people, communities and '
         'environment," said George Shultz , vice president and general '
         'manager, Air Mobility & Maritime Missions at Lockheed Martin. "As a '
         'variant of the C-130J Super Hercules, the FireHerc delivers a '
         'powerful combination of established performance advantages and '
         'innovative technology that will truly change the way we fight and '
         'defeat wildfires." The Hercules plays a vital role in firefighting '
         'by dispersing retardant to contain and control fires in locations '
         'with complex terrain and compromised operating conditions. The '
         "FireHerc's straight-wing design and turboprop power plant allows it "
         'to excel in supporting this challenging low-level, low-speed '
         'firefighting mission profile like no other large airtanker in '
         'operation. Additional FireHerc advantages include: More information '

 'text': 'COATESVILLE, Penn. , July 16, 2018 / PRNewswire / --\xa0Sikorsky, a '
         'Lockheed Martin company, has delivered an S-70 Black Hawk helicopter '
         'to the City of San Diego Fire-Rescue Department. When modified by a '
         'third party as a FIREHAWK ® helicopter with a 1,000-gallon belly '
         'tank, retractable snorkel, extended landing gear and rescue hoist, '
         'the City of San Diego will have a multirole platform with the speed '
         'to more quickly find and extinguish wildfires, perform rescue '
         'missions, and deliver initial medical care across the city and '
         'neighboring counties. "The Black Hawk is a game changer in its '
         'primary role of fire suppression in support of ground firefighting '
         'crews," said San Diego Fire-Rescue Air Operations Chief Chuck '
         'Macfarland during the June 27 ceremony to accept the aircraft at '
         'Sikorsky\'s facility in Coatesville, Pennsylvania . "Never before '
         'has the City of San Diego operated as large and as powerful a '
         'helicopter as the Black Hawk, which can accurately place almost '
         'three times more water on a wildland fire in a single drop than our '
         'current fleet. By hitting wildland fires aggressively in their '
         'initial stage, we will be able to keep fires small." Ahead of its '
         'modifications into the FIREHAWK configuration in 2019, San Diego '
         'Fire- Rescue will press the new helicopter into aerial firefighting '
         'service later this year using an 850-gallon internal tank. The S-70 '
         'Black Hawk helicopter has the engine power to carry over 4 US tons '
         'of water, and will operate with safe power margins in hot '
         "temperatures at high altitudes. The aircraft's high strength and "
         'corrosion resistant airframe significantly reduces maintenance '
         'costs. Said Joe Palumbo , Sikorsky international military programs '
         'director: "Aerial firefighting is a strenuous mission for any '
         'helicopter and its crew, but this third generation Hawk platform has '
         'the proven military pedigree and reliability to endure the '
         'tremendous physical stresses of acquiring, carrying and dropping '
         'large amounts of water repeatedly throughout the course of a day or '
         "night's firefighting operations. We welcome San Diego to the Black "
         'Hawk family, and wish the Fire-Rescue Department success during the '
         'aircraft\'s decades-long mission to save lives and property." The '
         "S-70 aircraft's advanced digital cockpit takes on many of the "
         "aircraft's flight functions, allowing the pilot to pre-program and "
         'manage the mission while adjusting flight parameters, such as speed, '
         'precision hover, heading and altitude, as needed. A digital moving '
         "map shows the pilot the aircraft's precise location and destination "
         'at all times. Among its standard safety features, the S-70 aircraft '
         'includes an Integrated Vehicle Health Management System to monitor '
         "the aircraft's operational health, and a terrain and obstacle "
         'avoidance system that alerts aircrew to the proximity of potential '
         'ground hazards. In addition to its principal mission of wildland '
         "fire suppression, San Diego's FIREHAWK aircraft can insert rescue "
         'medics, and hoist patients into the cabin for treatment and '
         'transport to a nearby hospital. The City of San Diego is the second '
         'municipality in southern California in the past year to procure the '
         'S-70 aircraft for aerial firefighting and other life-saving '
         'missions. In December 2017 , Los Angeles County Fire Department '
         'added two S-70i helicopters to its fleet of three existing FIREHAWK '
         'helicopters. In May, the California Department of Forestry and Fire '

 'text': 'DENVER , July 11, 2018 / PRNewswire / --\xa0Lockheed Martin (NYSE: '
         'LMT) has embraced a 3-D printed titanium dome for satellite fuel '
         "tanks so big you can't even put your arms around it. The 46-inch- "
         '(1.16-meter-) diameter vessel completed final rounds of quality '
         'testing this month, ending a multi-year development program to '
         'create giant, high-pressure tanks that carry fuel on board '
         'satellites. The titanium tank consists of three parts welded '
         'together: two 3-D printed domes that serve as caps, plus a '
         'variable-length, traditionally-manufactured titanium cylinder that '
         'forms the body. "Our largest 3-D printed parts to date show we\'re '
         'committed to a future where we produce satellites twice as fast and '
         'at half the cost," said Rick Ambrose , Lockheed Martin Space '
         'executive vice president. "And we\'re pushing forward for even '
         'better results. For example, we shaved off 87 percent of the '
         'schedule to build the domes, reducing the total delivery timeline '
         'from two years to three months." Satellite fuel tanks must be both '
         'strong and lightweight to withstand the rigors of launch and '
         'decade-long missions in the vacuum of space. That makes titanium an '
         'ideal material, but procuring 4-foot-diameter, 4-inch-thick titanium '
         'forgings can take a year or more, making them the most challenging '
         'and expensive parts of the tank. Traditional manufacturing '
         'techniques also meant that more than 80 percent of the material went '
         'to waste. Now, 3-D printing eliminates all that lost material for '
         'the domes, and the titanium used for printing is readily available '
         'with no wait time. "We self-funded this design and qualification '
         'effort as an investment in helping our customers move faster and '
         'save costs," explained Ambrose. "These tanks are part of a total '
         'transformation in the way we design and deliver space technology. '
         "We're making great strides in automation, virtual reality design and "
         'commonality across our satellite product line. Our customers want '
         'greater speed and value without sacrificing capability in orbit, and '
         'we\'re answering the call." Even the smallest leak or flaw could be '
         "catastrophic for a satellite's operations, so Lockheed Martin "
         'engineers went to great lengths to ensure the printed tanks meet or '
         'exceed the performance and reliability required by NASA. Engineers '
         'and technicians\xa0rigorously evaluated\xa0the structure,\xa0'
         'conducting a full suite of tests to\xa0demonstrate high tolerances '
         'and repeatability. The tank domes are a leap in size for qualified '
         '3-D printed materials. The largest part previously qualified was a '
         'toaster-size electronics enclosure for the Advanced Extremely High '
         "Frequency satellite program. Lockheed Martin's recent accomplishment "
         'continues a path of 3-D printed parts that bloomed in recent years. '
         'Since the company launched the first ever printed parts into deep '
         "space aboard NASA's Juno spacecraft, it has produced thousands of "
         'flight components and even more for tooling and prototyping using a '
         'variety of metals and composites. Technicians used Electron Beam '
         'Additive Manufacturing® to produce these domes in the largest 3-D '
         'printer at our facility in Denver . Lockheed Martin now offers the '
         'tank as a standard product option for LM 2100 satellite buses . '

 'text': 'FORT WORTH, Texas , July 13, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed Martin '
         '(NYSE: LMT) Skunk Works ® and the Defense Advanced Research Projects '
         'Agency (DARPA) recently performed a series of flight tests '
         'demonstrating how a system of systems (SoS) approach enables '
         'seamless – and rapid –\xa0integration across air, space, land, sea '
         'and cyber in contested environments. The demonstrations held at the '
         'Naval Air Warfare Center in China Lake, California , were part of a '
         'five year DARPA program called System of Systems Integration '
         'Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE). The flight tests '
         'demonstrated interoperability between a ground station, flying test '
         'bed, a C-12 and flight test aircraft, and proved the ability to '
         'transmit data between those systems using STITCHES, a novel '
         'integration technology. The test used the Skunk Works developed '
         'Enterprise Open System Architecture Mission Computer version 2 '
         '(EMC2), known as the "Einstein Box," as the open computing '
         'environment, providing security protections between systems. The '
         'Einstein Box enables rapid and secure experimentation before '
         'deploying the capability to operational systems. The team '
         'successfully demonstrated four key capabilities: Demonstrating rapid '
         'and affordable integration of mission systems into existing and new '
         'architectures, SoSITE will help U.S. forces maintain their advantage '
         'in today\'s dynamic world. "The successful demonstrations focused on '
         'advancing integration technologies to increase capabilities of '
         'systems in operation today, enabling our warfighters to use those '
         'systems in unexpected ways," said Justin Taylor , Lockheed Martin '
         'Skunk Works Mission Systems Roadmaps director. "The SoS approach is '
         'essential for allowing U.S. forces to rapidly reconfigure systems '
         'and prevail over any threat." The project was led by Lockheed Martin '
         'Skunk Works in partnership with the U.S. Air Force and support from '
         'industry partners Apogee Research, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin '
         'Missiles and Fire Control, BAE Systems, Phoenix Flight Test, General '
         "Dynamics and Rockwell Collins. Skunk Works' expertise in open system "
         'architecture spans more than a decade. The success of SoSITE is a '
         'critical step to enabling multi-domain operations and maintaining '
         'superiority in the future battlespace. In its 75th year, Lockheed '
         'Martin Skunk Works is proud to advance SoS integration in '
         'partnership with DARPA as they celebrate 60 years of creating '
         'breakthrough technologies and capabilities for national security. '

 'text': 'FARNBOROUGH, U nited Kingdom , July 17, 2018 — To expedite decision '
         'making in today’s threat environment, commanders need the ability to '
         'quickly transform terabytes of data received from unconnected '
         'systems into intelligence. That need will soon be answered by '
         'Lockheed Martin’s DIAMONDShield TM , an unprecedented enterprise '
         'system that has technically matured from a prototype into an '
         'operational system. “To address evolving threats with more '
         'confidence and greater efficiency, customers need ‘next-generation’ '
         'systems that connect across domains,” said Dr. Rob Smith, vice '
         'president of C4ISR & Unmanned Aerial Systems within Lockheed '
         'Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems. “DIAMONDShield represents that '
         'next-generation solution.” DIAMONDShield is the foundation of an '
         'integrated air and missile defense system being developed for an '
         'international customer.\xa0 Recently, this system successfully '
         'participated in joint capability demonstrations where DIAMONDShield '
         'connected the air operations center with missile defense and ISR '
         'capabilities to execute various mission scenarios. In developing '
         'DIAMONDShield, Lockheed Martin leveraged its more than 50 year '
         'legacy designing command and control systems. With that expertise, '
         'the company created a system that links disparate platforms and '
         'systems operating across air, land, sea and space to give customers '
         'a layered, integrated defense that crosses domains. Any desired '
         'concept of operations can be integrated into the system. With a '
         'single click, the automation incorporated into DIAMONDShield allows '
         'customers to predict and assess enemy intent, make rapid tactical '
         'decisions and send engagement tasks to assets in theater. The system '
         'can receive from any external source using standards such as the '
         'Link 16 or Link 11 protocols — from aircraft to missile defense '
         'systems, to radar and air traffic control systems —\xa0 correlating '
         'the data into a comprehensive, bird’s eye visualization of the '
         'battlespace. Another distinctive feature is the system’s automated '
         'air mission planning capability. Within minutes after inserting the '
         'desired mission criteria, DIAMONDShield’s complex algorithms create '
         'air tasking orders (ATO).\xa0 After the initial ATO is created, the '
         'system continues to look for more efficient options to support '
         'current and future missions. DIAMONDShield can support simultaneous '
         'strategic and combat planning, mission execution, advanced '
         'battlespace monitoring, joint and coalition force collaboration and '
         'enemy intention analysis. For more information visit: Lockheed '

         "capabilities of these ships and they're going to be an integral part "
         'of the small surface combatants." Spencer visited to view the '
         'modernized production line and tour LCS 13, the future USS WICHITA. '
         'Over the past 10 years, the Freedom-variant industry team invested '
         'more than $120 million to modernize the shipyard, hire more than '
         '1,000 people and train a new workforce. This private investment '
         'optimized the shipyard for serial production at a rate of two '
         'Littoral Combat Ships per year. The Lockheed Martin-led LCS team is '
         'comprised of shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine, naval '
         'architect Gibbs & Cox, and more than 800 suppliers in 42 states. The '
