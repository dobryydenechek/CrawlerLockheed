 'text': 'Syracuse, N.Y. June 8, 2022 – On May 26, 2022, the STARE Project '
         'Office, U.S. Army Sentinel Product Office received the first five '
         'radars of its initial contract with Lockheed Martin. The Sentinel A4 '
         'radar is developed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Syracuse, '
         'N.Y., and has been on an accelerated schedule since the project was '
         'awarded in September 2019. “We are one step closer to getting this '
         'enhanced capability to our warfighters,” stated Leah Cook, Sentinel '
         'Product Director for the U.S. Army Sentinel A4 program office. “The '
         'delivery of the first five radars is a result of collaboration and a '
         'continued commitment to the U.S. Army.” The U.S. Army and Lockheed '
         'Martin have a strong partnership founded on collaboration and trust. '
         'The process has included virtual reviews and working groups to '
         'maintain momentum through all program development phases. “Our team '
         'understands the criticality of this technology and the need to get '
         'it fielded,” said Mark Mekker, director of Army Radars for Lockheed '
         'Martin. “Our soldiers are in unpredictable environments, and the '
         'Sentinel A4 will provide improved eyes on the field to keep them '
         'safe.” What’s Next? Lockheed Martin will support the Army in the '
         'government test program phase into early 2023. The radars will '
         'undergo mobility, environmental, radar performance and logistics '
         'testing. Production of the next five radar systems is already '
         'underway, and delivery is expected to begin in March 2023. Future '
         'Forward to Protect Against Evolving Threats The Sentinel A4’s open '
         'scalable radar architecture is the cornerstone of the radar system’s '
         'design and allows for addressing evolving threats with software '
         'modifications only. The new air and missile defense radar will '
         'provide improved capability over the previous iteration, the '
         'Sentinel A3. It will outperform the legacy radar, delivering '
         'improvements in contested environments against cruise missiles, '
         'unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft, and '
         'rocket, artillery, and mortar threats.\xa0 This includes enhanced '
         'surveillance, detection, and classification capabilities to protect '
         'U.S. Army maneuver formations. Efficiencies & Cost Savings Lockheed '
         'Martin radars are designed with a high degree of commonality. The '
         'company’s TPY-4 ground based air surveillance radar was built and '
         'validated under Lockheed Martin investment and significantly '
         'leveraged the Sentinel A4 radar design. “Commonality across the '
         'radar portfolio enable sustainment efficiencies and significant cost '
         'savings for our customers. Our scalable technology, coupled with '
         'these efficiencies, has resulted in significant international '
         'interest in both the Sentinel A4 and TPY-4 radars to replace older '
         'assets that simply cannot be upgraded to match what our next '
         'generation systems are offering,” said Chandra Marshall, Vice '
         'President and General Manager of Lockheed Martin’s Radar and Sensor '
         'Systems business. Lockheed Martin continues to invest significantly '
         'in the advancement of its software-defined radar technology, '

 'text': 'Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) have signed a '
         'teaming agreement for future T-50 opportunities, the newest '
         'partnership in the decades-long relationship between the companies. '
         '“Lockheed Martin is an air power solutions leader, delivering '
         'capabilities across the entire spectrum of training and combat '
         'aircraft,” says Aimee Burnett, vice president, Integrated Fighter '
         'Group Business Development at Lockheed Martin. “We are proud to '
         'continue to partner with KAI on the T-50 to leverage our collective '
         'experiences to train the next generation of pilots to fly, fight and '
         'win." She says the T-50 is a proven aircraft program that reduces '
         'the learning curve for new pilots and gets them flying operational '
         'sorties faster – even in fifth-generation aircraft like the F-35. '
         'That’s important as air forces around the world need to get their '
         'pilots up to speed faster than ever before, whether that’s to fill a '
         'gap in personnel or due to increased frequency of combat missions. '
         '“That’s where the benefits of the proven T-50 program really come '
         'into play,” she says.\xa0“The seamless training experience with the '
         'T-50 gives student pilots an additional edge and fully prepares them '
         '– in less time than in the past – to fly any combat mission.” The '
         'program has reduced the number of required flights for Korean pilots '
         'learning in the KF-16 to only nine sorties. Feedback from many of '
         'the 2,500 pilots who have been trained in the T-50 across 3,750 test '
         'flights says it’s easy to fly and offers controls similar to other '
         'Lockheed Martin aircraft like the F-16 and F-35. This allows student '
         'pilots to focus their airmanship skills on improved aero '
         'performance, digital flight controls and next-generation air traffic '
         'management systems. Additionally, a ground-based training system '
         'contains an array of innovative technologies to provide options for '
         'training in a simulation environment. Digital Advances in '
         'Production, Sustainment At any given time, around the world, '
         'Lockheed Martin is working side-by-side with those in uniform to '
         'keep fleets ready to fly at a moment’s notice. “We are focused on '
         'readiness for the fleets and customers we support and bringing new '
         'digital tools to enable new capabilities,” Aimee says. “And we’re '
         'seeing success. As an example, with the T-50, the mission capable '
         'rate is holding strong at 90% across 300,000 flight hours – an '
         'outstanding result that demonstrates our focus.” And from a '
         'production standpoint, T-50 components can be shipped to a single '
         'location and produced with minimal space with maximum ease. That’s '
         'because aircraft components would be shipped in two containers and '
         'ready upon arrival in their home destination, for final assembly and '
         'check-out. Additional T-50 Facts The T-50 program was originally '
         'developed by KAI in partnership with Lockheed Martin, and took its '
         'maiden flight in 2002 and its first production flight in 2005. Since '
         'then, 208 have been produced with an additional 28 on order across a '
         'number of aerobatic and combat variants including the T-50A, T-50B, '
         'TA-50, and FA-50.',

 'text': 'EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., May 17 2022 – The U.S. Air Force and '
         'Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] successfully conducted a '
         'hypersonic-boosted flight test of the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid '
         'Response Weapon (ARRW) from the service’s B-52H Stratofortress. The '
         'successful flight demonstrates the weapon’s ability to reach and '
         'withstand operational hypersonic speeds, collect crucial data for '
         'use in further flight tests, and validate safe separation from the '
         'aircraft to deliver the glide body and warhead to designated targets '
         'from significant standoff distances. “The need for hypersonic strike '
         'capabilities is critical to our nation and this successful test will '
         'help us to maintain an accelerated and rigorous timeline,” said Dave '
         'Berganini, vice president of Hypersonic and Strike Systems at '
         'Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control. “Our strong partnership '
         'with the U.S. Air Force has allowed us to quickly progress '
         'hypersonic technologies for our men and women in uniform.” “The ARRW '
         'rapid prototyping program used Section 804 authorities provided by '
         'Congress to significantly accelerate the development and test of '
         'this system, without sacrificing engineering rigor,” said Marya '
         'Bard, U.S. Air Force ARRW program director. “The tightly integrated '
         'Lockheed Martin and government team achieved speed with discipline '
         'by focusing on a common vision of providing combatant commanders a '
         'survivable rapid response strike capability as early as possible.” '
         'Additional booster and all-up-round test flights will continue '
         'throughout 2022, before reaching Early Operational Capability (EOC) '
         'in 2023. Hypersonic weapons provide a rapid response, time critical '
         'capability to overcome distance in contested environments using high '
         'speed, altitude and maneuverability. Hypersonic technology has '
         'continued to present several complex engineering challenges. Going '
         'Mach 5, sometimes even faster, generates extreme levels of heat, '
         'driving the need for innovative materials, sensors and electronics '
         'to withstand such speeds throughout its journey. In addition to '
         'heat, these systems must be able to maintain consistent '
         'communication connections, as well as considerable intelligence to '
         'perform precise maneuverability techniques to overcome a wide range '
         'of advanced defense systems and extreme contested environments. '

         'Arkansas BETHESDA, Md. , May 18, 2022 / PRNewswire / -- Lockheed '
         'Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Airbus leaders announced today the aerial '
         'refueling boom system for the LMXT strategic tanker aircraft will be '
         'manufactured by Airbus in\xa0western Arkansas . Introduced in\xa0'
         "September 2021, the LMXT is Lockheed Martin's offering for the U.S. "
         'Air Force\'s KC-Y strategic tanker program.     "Given the '
         "undisputed importance of the U.S. Air Force's strategic refueling "
         'mission, ensuring the LMXT is equipped with critical and relevant '
         'technologies for its refueling system is of paramount importance. '
         'Like the LMXT airframe, this refueling system is proven and '
         'low-risk, translating to known and added capabilities for the U.S. '
         'Air Force," said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President, and CEO\xa0'
         'James Taiclet. "With this commitment, Arkansas\' manufacturing '
         "community has the opportunity to contribute to building America's "
         'next strategic tanker." The LMXT is built on the combat-proven '
         'design of the\xa0Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT),\xa0'
         'which is the strategic tanking choice of 14 nations around the '
         'world. Offering several distinct U.S. Air Force-only capabilities '
         'designed to meet operator requirements, the LMXT offers advantages '
         'like\xa0an established fly-by-wire aerial refueling boom. Currently '
         'certified and used by allies to refuel U.S. Air Force aircraft in '
         "operations globally, the world's first fully automatic air-to-air "
         'refueling (A3R) system is a discrete asset. "We are excited to '
         'continue expanding our U.S. footprint by partnering with the state '
         'of Arkansas to create the LMXT refueling boom production site and '
         'center of excellence. It is an honor to bring Airbus innovation to '
         'the state for this and future manufacturing opportunities," said '
         'C.\xa0Jeffrey Knittel, chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas. "The '
         'state-of-the-art boom system is a vital aspect of the overall LMXT '
         'offering, and we are proud to be working with Arkansans to build '
         'this best-in-class solution for the U.S. Air Force." While the exact '
         'location of the manufacturing facility has yet to be determined, it '
         'will expand Airbus\' footprint into "The Natural State." '
         'Manufacturing plays a significant role in the Arkansas economy, '
         "accounting for about 15% of the state's economic output. More than "
         '12% of all Arkansas residents are employed by the manufacturing '
         'industry, according to the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. '
         '"Lockheed Martin consistently sets the standard for aerospace and '
         "defense worldwide and significantly contributes to Arkansas' robust "
         'aerospace and defense industry," said Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson . '
         '" Arkansas has the tools in place to help high-tech manufacturing '
         "succeed, and I'm pleased that Lockheed Martin and Airbus see "
         'themselves growing here in our state as they look to the future in '
         'the defense industry." Lockheed Martin\'s manufacturing presence in '
         'Arkansas dates back to 1978 with its Camden Operations facility. '
         'This facility is a manufacturing, final assembly, test and storage '
         'operation for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) '
         "programs. Approximately 1,030 employees work in the facility's "
         'manufacturing and support buildings. "I am thrilled Arkansas has '
         "been selected to manufacture the LMXT's boom, bringing well-paying "
         'jobs to our state and strengthening our economy. Most importantly, '
         "I'm proud Arkansas will continue to increase our contributions in "
         "support of America's men and women in uniform and our national "
         'defense," said U.S. Sen. John Boozman , who serves as the senior '
         'senator from Arkansas. The LMXT aerial refueling system work is the '
         'first manufacturing opportunity for Airbus in Arkansas , but builds '
         'on an extensive manufacturing presence across the southeastern '
         'United States . Airbus builds the A320 and A220 airliners in Alabama '
         ', H125 and UH-72 Lakota helicopters in Mississippi , and satellites '
         'in Florida . The workforce across these facilities is more than 30% '
         'U.S. military veterans. "Flights of freedom will be sustained by '
         'equipment made right here in Arkansas ! This announcement further '
         "strengthens the Third District's role in our nation's defense, and "
         "our community's strong workforce and infrastructure are ready to "
         'support the manufacturing of the state-of-the-art LMXT system," said '
         "U.S. Rep. Steve Womack , who represents Arkansas' 3rd Congressional "
         'District. "Arkansans are proud knowing the leading role they\'ll '
         "have in building the next generation of the Air Force's "
         "capabilities. I look forward to a fair and open competition that I'm "
         'sure the LMXT will win." This announcement follows Lockheed '
         "Martin's and Airbus' recently publicized plan to expand their "
         'footprints in Georgia and Alabama to support future LMXT assembly '
         'and configuration. The\xa0 LMXT will be built in two phases: '
         'Integration of the Arkansas -built boom will be included in Phase 2 '
         'of the assembly and configuration process. The LMXT complements the '
         "U.S. Air Force's tanker capabilities by providing the most advanced "
         "aerial refueler to meet America's immediate and long-term mission "
         'requirements. The LMXT strengthens and expands the U.S. aerospace '
         'industrial base by working with existing and new American suppliers. '
         '"Arkansans are proud of the men and women who fight for our freedoms '
         'and the civilian workers who support them," Arkansas Secretary of '
         'Commerce Mike Preston said. "The LMXT tanker will be built in '
         'America, by Americans, for Americans — a mission that Arkansas '
         'encourages all manufacturers to embrace as we seek to bring quality '
         'jobs back to the U.S.A. and increase economic opportunities for '
         'American workers and American communities." The LMXT offers a proven '
         'airframe with distinct U.S. Air Force-only capabilities designed to '
         'meet operator requirements, with advantages that also include: As '
         'the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin works directly to implement '

         'Javelin Joint Venture two production contracts for Javelin missiles '
         'and associated equipment and services with total value of $309 '
         'million. These contracts include more than 1300 Javelin missiles '
         'funded from the recent Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act and '
         'orders for several international customers including Norway, '
         'Albania, Latvia and Thailand. Javelin is developed and produced by '
         'the Javelin Joint Venture, a partnership of Raytheon Missiles & '
         'Defense and Lockheed Martin. The versatile anti-tank and '
         'multi-target guided missile system offers fire-and-forget capability '
         'over its full range – up to 4 kilometers in most operational '
         'conditions. “The Javelin Joint Venture is working hard to meet this '
         'increase in demand,” says Dave Pantano, Javelin Joint Venture vice '
         'president and Lockheed Martin Javelin program director. “Javelin’s '
         'unique capabilities have proven to be a difference-maker in our '

         'Lockheed Martin is investing to increase the missile production rate '
         'beyond the current 2,100 per year. Likewise, Raytheon is investing '
         'to maximize production of the reusable light-weight command launch '
         'unit. To date, the Javelin Joint Venture has produced more than '

         '“Lockheed Martin is confident that the sailors of Littoral Combat '

         'supporting maritime security and deterrence. The LCS '
         'Freedom-variant, operationally deployed today, is an unmatched and '
         'highly adaptable warship, designed to outpace the growing threat of '
         'our adversaries and fulfill the dynamic missions of the U.S. Navy. '
         'Our team of more than 800 suppliers maintains a strong partnership '
         'with the U.S. Navy to add lethality and survivability enhancements '
         'to the highly capable and resilient LCS class.” – Steve Allen, '
         'Lockheed Martin vice president, Small Combatants and Ship Systems In '
         '2011, Major General Marcia Anderson was named the first female '
         'African American officer to earn her second star in the U.S. Army '
         'reserves. When the former Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable '
         'Richard Spencer, directed that LCS 29 be named after the City of '
         'Beloit, he also asked that General Anderson be honored as the ship '
         'sponsor. “I am honored and excited to be a part of the christening '
         'and launch of the USS Beloit. As a Beloit native, I am well aware of '
         'the long history my city has had as it supported our national '
         'security by not just providing people who served, but also helped '
         'build the amazing ships and vehicles that have made our military the '
         'envy of the world. I know the USS Beloit will carry that tradition '
         'forward as she and her crew become an integral part of our nation’s '
         'history, and I am happy to be able to play a small role as the '
         'Sponsor during the life of this great ship.” –Major General Marcia '
         'M. Anderson, USA (Ret.), Ship Sponsor of the future USS Beloit (LCS '
         '29) The Lockheed Martin-led LCS team is comprised of shipbuilder '
         'Fincantieri Marinette Marine, naval architect Gibbs & Cox, and more '
         'than 800 suppliers in 42 states. Built at the Midwest’s only naval '
         'shipyard, LCS production supports 12,500 U.S. jobs, including more '
         'than 7,500 jobs in Wisconsin and Michigan. “Shipbuilding is hard '
         'work, done by dedicated professionals. And I could not be more proud '
         'of the work done by our team here in Marinette to get another '
         'Freedom-class warship built and in the water where she belongs.” – '
         'Mark Vandroff, Fincantieri Marinette Marine CEO Unique among combat '
         'ships, LCS is deployed today for close-to-shore missions and is a '
         'growing and relevant part of the Navy’s fleet. In the last year, '
         'Freedom-variant Littoral Combat ships have supported the Navy on '
         'various missions including several counter-illicit drug trafficking '
         'in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific resulting in hundreds of '
         'millions of dollars in narcotics seizures. Its speed, strength and '
         'versatility make it a critical tool to help sailors achieve their '
         'missions. Recently, the Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship for the '
         'first time has deployed to US 6th Fleet, as a measure of assurance '
         'for NATO allies and partners in Europe and Africa. LCS 29 is the '
         '15th Freedom-variant LCS and 29th in the LCS class. It is the first '
         'ship named in honor of the city of Beloit, Wisconsin. Lockheed '
         'Martin is in full-rate production and has delivered 11 ships to the '
         'U.S. Navy. There are five ships in various stages of production. '

 'text': 'Syracuse, New York, May 4, 2022 – The world’s most advanced and '
         'capable transportable or fixed air defense long-range radar, '
         'Lockheed Martin’s first AN/TPY-4 radar – recently selected by the '
         'U.S. Air Force for the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range '
         'Radar (3DELRR) Rapid Prototyping program – has completed production '
         'marking availability to the world.\xa0 The technology that enables '
         'TPY-4 provides the capability required for today’s threats and '
         'unprecedented flexibility to adjust quickly to those that emerge '
         'over time. “Lockheed Martin is committed to investing in advanced '
         'defense technology, and the TPY-4 radar is a direct result of those '
         'investments,” said Rick Herodes, Director of Ground Based Air '
         'Surveillance Radars at Lockheed Martin. “TPY-4 meets the needs of a '
         'rapidly changing battlefields, marked by technological growth and '
         'the emergence of increasingly challenging threats.” Milestones & '
         'Maturity Development Lockheed Martin has been on the fast track to '
         'provide this radar both in the U.S. and internationally. In March, '
         'the U.S. Air Force selected the TPY-4 radar as the best radar for '
         'the 3DELRR program. The 3DELRR contract includes production options '
         'for 35 long-range radar systems, planned to reach Initial '
         'Operational Capability. In July 2021, the radar received official '
         'nomenclature from the U.S. Government and Kongsberg Defence & '
         'Aerospace (KDA) delivered the Platform Electronics Subsystem (PES) '
         'for the first TPY-4 radar. The Lockheed Martin and KDA partnership '
         'leverages Lockheed Martin’s state of the art radar technology and '
         'KDA’s experience in defense industry solutions, resulting in a next '
         'generation sensor that meets and exceeds current long range '
         'surveillance requirements. The World’s First Truly Software-Defined '
         'Radar TPY 4 is intentionally designed as a multi-mission system '
         'capable of tracking current and emerging threats, and will integrate '
         'seamlessly into existing air defense systems. TPY-4 is an '
         'internationally available, transportable, multi-mission radar that '
         'can operate in contested RF environments. The radar integrates the '
         'latest mature commercial technologies to create a revolutionary '
         'radar architecture. The radar system is fully digital at every '
         'transmit/receive element with an unprecedented software-defined '
         'sensor architecture, allowing the radar to quickly adjust to '
         'tomorrow’s threats and missions. It’s individually '
         'software-controlled digital transmitters and receivers provide '
         'flexibility to quickly change performance for new missions and '
         'environments while providing ease of adaptation to future advanced '
         'threats. Performance and operational changes can be made rapidly via '
         'software enhancements without the design or hardware changes '
         'required by older radar architectures. TPY-4 outperforms other '
         'systems in these key areas: Target Detection: TPY-4 detects smaller, '
         'harder-to-detect next generation threats in heavy clutter. Mission '
         'Diversity: The radar operators can quickly pivot from one mission to '
         'another, enabling them to address threats in a contested '
         'environment. The radar will operate in extreme climates and '
         'environments. Software Defined: The system is digital at every '
         'element with operation and performance defined software enabling '
         'quick upgrades to combat emerging threats. TPY-4 adheres to open '
